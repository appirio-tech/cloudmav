      \t\t<description>If you've known me for any length of time, you probably know that I highly encourage everyone to use a password vault of some kind. There are several good ones available some of them are free, other's cost money. Over the years I've tried several and the ones I've used the most are KeePass and more recently LastPass. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/05/06/my-thoughts-on-lastpass/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve known me for any length of time, you probably know that I highly encourage everyone to use a password vault of some kind.  There are several good ones available some of them are free, other&#8217;s cost money.  Over the years I&#8217;ve tried several and the ones I&#8217;ve used the most are <a href=\"http://www.keepass.info\">KeePass</a> and more recently <a title=\"LastPass\" href=\"http://www.lastpass.com\">LastPass</a>.</p>\n\
      <p>Yesterday, the internet was on fire over the <a href=\"http://blog.lastpass.com/2011/05/lastpass-security-notification.html\">possible intrusion to LastPass&#8217;s server</a>s (please read this as I feel it&#8217;s the proper way to handle such a situation). \xC2\xA0But I want to point out 2 things, which are mentioned in the article:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n\
      <li>LastPass is very clear in that they are not 100% sure something was breached</li>\n\
      <li>They did notice a traffic anomaly that they couldn&#8217;t explain</li>\n\
      </ol>\n\
      <p>These are very important points that need to be considered when it comes to using LastPass. \xC2\xA0But I want to give my thoughts since I actually use the service.</p>\n\
      <h2>Your Passwords Are Probably Safe</h2>\n\
      <p>One of the main arguments people give against LastPass is that it puts all your passwords in the cloud on their servers. \xC2\xA0While true, that&#8217;s not the full story. You can read their website where they <a href=\"https://lastpass.com/whylastpass_technology.php\">explain how it all works</a>, but I&#8217;ll give you the gist. Basically when you sign up for last pass, the vault for your passwords is created locally, encrypted, and then uploaded to their servers. \xC2\xA0They don&#8217;t have a way to unlock it on their end. You have to have your master password to be able to unlock anything around your LastPass vault.</p>\n\
      <p>On top of that, LastPass is giving everyone a set of options. A user can do any of the following:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n\
      <li>Change their master password</li>\n\
      <li>Not change their master password now, and be reminded to do so later</li>\n\
      <li>Take the risk and not change their master password</li>\n\
      </ol>\n\
      <p>By making people change their passwords, they&#8217;re attempting to negate any issue a possible intrusion might cause. \xC2\xA0If you have a really strong master password, then you&#8217;re probably okay (if your master password is &#8220;password&#8221; you&#8217;re doing it wrong).</p>\n\
      <p>Also, I think that LastPass handled this situation really well. They informed their users, and are requiring them to take action, even though all they found was a traffic\xC2\xA0anomaly, and not an actual breach. They are standing on the side of caution, and since they&#8217;re a password vault, that&#8217;s exactly what you should want them to do.</p>\n\
      <h2>What I&#8217;m Going to Do (and What You Should Do Too)</h2>\n\
      <p>I&#8217;m going to move to using two factor authentication with my LastPass account. \xC2\xA0What this means is that not only will I need my LastPass credentials (email address and password), but also some other way of authenticating myself to access my LastPass password vault. \xC2\xA0LastPass offers multiple options for this, and they should be researched to find one that works best for you.</p>\n\
      <p>However, other password vaults offer similar functionality. \xC2\xA0I know that KeePass offers this, but I&#8217;m not sure about <a href=\"http://agilebits.com/onepassword\">1Password</a>.</p>\n\
      <p>If you&#8217;re using a password vault, I would recommend moving to using two factor authentication. \xC2\xA0I would also recommend doing so for any site that offers the ability to use two factor authentication (Gmail and several banks offer this). \xC2\xA0Doing so helps lower the risk of you being compromised.</p>\n\
      <h2>Password Vaults</h2>\n\
      <p>Below is a list of password vaults. Please consider using one of these and start using secure passwords (and different passwords on different sites). \xC2\xA0Please note that outside of LastPass and KeePass I don&#8217;t know too much about the others.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>I recently spent some time setting up my *nix configuration files for Bash and VIM in a repository on Github. Since I used several git repositories for handling my various VIM plugins and color schemes, I utilized git\xE2\x80\x99s submodule functionality &amp;#8230; &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/05/02/using-git-submodules/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/250px-Git-logo.svg_.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Git Logo\" width=\"250\" height=\"96\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1644\" />I recently spent some time setting up my *nix configuration files for Bash and VIM in a <a href=\"http://www.github.com/mkoby/dotmatrix\">repository on Github</a>. Since I used several git repositories for handling my various VIM plugins and color schemes, I utilized git\xE2\x80\x99s submodule functionality to link to the original repositories, allowing me to keep the plugins up to date.  Today I want to look a little closer at <a href=\"http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html\">Git submodules</a> and how I\xE2\x80\x99m using them.</p>\n\
      <h2>Setting Up a Submodule</h2>\n\
      <p>Setting up a submodule in git, is actually fairly easy, you just pass in the repository address and the folder you want it to go to. So for example, on my VIM plugins, I use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails\">vim-rails plugin by Tim Pope</a>. So to create a git submodule off of this repository for the plugin I use the following:</p>\n\
      <pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ;\">\n\
      [~/git/dotmatrix]$ git submodule add \\\n\
      https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails.git \\\n\
      vim/bundle/vim-rails\n\
      </pre>\n\
      <p>This will create a \xE2\x80\x9Cvim-rails\xE2\x80\x9D folder in vim/bundle/ and then download the files from the repository. Meaning that when I commit and then push my dotmatrix repository, it will upload the information for the submodules into my repository on Github. When I set up a new computer, I simply install Git, and then run the following:</p>\n\
      <pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ;\">\n\
      [~/git]$ git clone \\\n\
      git@github.com:mkoby/dotmatrix.git --recursive\n\
      </pre>\n\
      <p>You\xE2\x80\x99ll note the \xE2\x80\x9C&#8211;recursive\xE2\x80\x9D argument, this is what tells git to first download the files for the repository and then recursively create the folders and download the files for the submodules.  I then run my setup script that sets up the various configuration files to their appropriate locations so that I\xE2\x80\x99m ready to code with just a few commands.</p>\n\
      <h2>Updating the Submodules</h2>\n\
      <p>Once you have the submodules, you have to update them from time to time. Maybe there\xE2\x80\x99s a bug fix, or maybe a new feature in your submodules. To update them is actually quite simple, you simply run the following command:</p>\n\
      <pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ;\">\n\
      [~/git/dotmatrix]$ git submodule foreach \\\n\
      \xE2\x80\x98git pull origin master\xE2\x80\x99\n\
      </pre>\n\
      <p>This goes through each submodule\xE2\x80\x99s folder and runs a regular \xE2\x80\x9Cgit pull\xE2\x80\x9D on the folder bringing in the latest changes. The \xE2\x80\x9Cforeach\xE2\x80\x9D argument is actually built into git\xE2\x80\x99s submodule functionality, so there is no hidden magic here.</p>\n\
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\
      <p>This is the primary place I\xE2\x80\x99m using Git\xE2\x80\x99s Submodule functionality, but this could be used to separate out various project files into separate repositories for better project organization. If anyone sees that I\xE2\x80\x99m doing something wrong, just let me know as I\xE2\x80\x99m always looking to improve my workflows.</p>\n\

      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost four years ago, I left working for Prudential Real Estate Services to go work as a consultant Sogeti. The intent was to surround myself with programmers in hopes that I could learn to become a better programmer myself. I\xE2\x80\x99d like to say that the experiment was a success.  I met some really great people, who taught me a great many things. It wasn\xE2\x80\x99t all about the programming all the time, but I did get to work on tons of different projects, doing many different kinds of work.</p>\n\
      <p>But good things always have to come to an end at some point and a new beginning must be made. There are always new lessons to learn, new challenges to overcome, and cool new projects to get involved with.  So as of today, I\xE2\x80\x99m not longer employed by Sogeti, and will be moving on to a stealth-startup here in Houston.</p>\n\
      <p>Before you ask, no, this is not my startup, it\xE2\x80\x99s someone elses. I\xE2\x80\x99ll still be working on Just for Bands and a couple of other projects I have in the works (more on these soon, I hope). But this is a company that hired me to work with them on getting their product launched.  Since I have a little bit of experience in that area, here\xE2\x80\x99s hoping I can help them with theirs.</p>\n\
      <p>What will I be doing? At first it will mainly be Ruby on Rails work. But long term there is some mobile application development that will need to be done and I\xE2\x80\x99m hoping I can get my feet wet in that area too. I\xE2\x80\x99m the second developer on the ground, so there\xE2\x80\x99s some room for growth as well. It promises to be an interesting project where I will get to apply some of the things I have recently learned about Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and getting an app from idea to launch. Hopefully I can learn a few things along the way as well.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Google announced that they would be holding back with regards to releasing the latest version of the Android operating system. The release in question, Android 3.0 aka Honeycomb aka the version for tablets. The reasoning for this they say is two fold: 1) the code isn\xE2\x80\x99t ready to be released to the public, and 2) they don\xE2\x80\x99t want manufacturers attempting to put Honeycomb on smaller form factor devices (read \xE2\x80\x9Cmobile phones\xE2\x80\x9D).\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Then Google announced today that they were going to tighten the requirements on releasing Android based products. More specifically they were going to enforce the clause in their licensing agreement (the one that allows companies to use the \xE2\x80\x9Cwith Google\xE2\x80\x9D tag on their devices like the recently released Motorola Xoom) that the devices must meet certain standards and certain objectives must be met.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I want to look at both of these things in this article, because they kind of go hand in hand. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/04/01/google-android-and-open-source/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\

      <p>Then Google announced yesterday that they were going to tighten the requirements on releasing Android based products. More specifically they were going to enforce the clause in their licensing agreement (the one that allows companies to use the \xE2\x80\x9Cwith Google\xE2\x80\x9D tag on their devices like the recently released Motorola Xoom) that the devices must meet certain standards and certain objectives must be met.</p>\n\
      <p>I want to look at both of these things in this article, because they kind of go hand in hand.<span id=\"more-1621\"></span></p>\n\
      <h3>Open Sourcing Code</h3>\n\
      <p>If you are not familiar with the term \xE2\x80\x9Copen source\xE2\x80\x9D to simplify things (because trust me that term is a can of worms), it basically means that the source code, or rather the application code for a computer program is available to the public to download, modify, and even re-release, if they adhere to the license under which the code was released.</p>\n\
      <p>The base Android operating system is open sourced. If you want, you can follow the instructions and download the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) to your computer, modify the code, compile it, and (if brave enough) put it on your device. As newer versions of Android are released on devices, the source code is then placed into the AOSP source code repository.  What Google recently announced is that they would be holding back releasing Honeycomb source to the AOSP repository. Lets look at their reasons, and my thoughts on them as well.</p>\n\
      <p>But before going further I want to make one thing clear. Google never stated that they would never release the Honeycomb source code. Not once. They just said they weren\xE2\x80\x99t going to release it \xE2\x80\x9Crignt now\xE2\x80\x9D.  There\xE2\x80\x99s a huge difference.</p>\n\
      <h4>The Code Isn\xE2\x80\x99t Ready for Release</h4>\n\
      <p>If you\xE2\x80\x99ve followed the Android story, you know that recently Google hired one of the primary user interface (UI) designers from Palm. He was (obviously) tasked with bringing a nicer user experience to Android (something that many people have long complained about). Honeycomb is the first release of this new UI (you could say Android 2.3 was, but really that was nothing more than a new skin, Honeycomb\xE2\x80\x99s UI changes go deep).</p>\n\
      <p>When it comes to Honeycomb, the turnaround time on the new tablet version of Android was pretty quick (say around 9 months). And if anyone knows anything about writing code, they probably know that this means the code is hacked together is probably held together with little more than scotch tape. In other words, this isn\xE2\x80\x99t Google\xE2\x80\x99s finest work and so they\xE2\x80\x99re not really wanting to put it out on display to the public just yet.</p>\n\
      <p>Also, it was announced (before this announcment, oh how quickly the internet forgets), that much of the user interface changes in Honeycomb would be merged into \xE2\x80\x9CIce Cream\xE2\x80\x9D (the next version of the phone OS), and that Google plans to bring all of Android back under a single version again, eliminating the need for two different versions of the OS for different kinds of devices.  So when I read this announcement, this was my first thought.</p>\n\
      <p>\xE2\x80\x9COf course\xE2\x80\x9D I said to myself, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy not wait to release the code when you\xE2\x80\x99re back to a single codebase.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
      <p>It makes sense to first clean up the code, and then bring it back in line with the rest of the code so that you can return to a single code base when it\xE2\x80\x99s released.</p>\n\
      <h4>Non-Tablet Devices</h4>\n\
      <p>The first Android tablets to hit the market all ran Android 2.2 (ie Frozen Yogurt, aka Froyo). Google advised companies to not do this, stating that Froyo wasn\xE2\x80\x99t designed with tablets in mind. When they made that public statement they also announced that they were in fact working on a version for tablets, and pleaded with manufacturers to hold off on releasing Android based tablets.</p>\n\
      <p>Those manufacturers didn\xE2\x80\x99t listen.</p>\n\
      <p>So Google is learning from their mistakes. They know they\xE2\x80\x99re going to merge the 2 form factor code bases back into a single code base, they\xE2\x80\x99ve announced as such. They do not want manufacturers putting Honeycomb on phone size devices (the opposite of what was done with the tablets).</p>\n\
      <p>This goes back to Google probably wanting to wait until they\xE2\x80\x99re back onto a single code base for all device types before releasing the source code to AOSP.</p>\n\
      <h3>Google Tightens Their Grip</h3>\n\
      <p>When Android was first announced, they went to great lengths to push the open source angle. What this open sourcing of Android meant was that manufacturers had a base operating system to build off of. It gave them a fighting edge in the fight against the now (out of the blue) popular Apple iPhone. Really, the iPhone came out and caught every cell phone manufacturer off guard, they didn\xE2\x80\x99t have a plan to compete, Android helped. There was a base OS that they could build on, and many did.  Phone makers HTC, Samsung, and Motorola all released devices using Android with their own user interface.</p>\n\
      <p>These interfaces (some of them) improve on the user interface of Android.  The SenseUI from HTC being fairly popular. But they cause delays when it comes to getting newer versions of Android onto mobile phones because the manufacturers have to make deep modifcations to have the new version of Android work with their third party user interfaces. This in turn leads to what many people have begun calling \xE2\x80\x9Cfragmentation\xE2\x80\x9D and means that there are, at any given moment, a number of different Android versions on phones in the market.</p>\n\
      <p>Google also has some language in their license for Android that sets certain requirements for the devices if they want to use the \xE2\x80\x9Cwith Google\xE2\x80\x9D branding and install the Google applications suite (Gmail, Android Market, etc). What Google has actually announced is that they will be more strictly enforcing this clause. The end goal, limiting fragmentation. Limiting the number of different versions of Android in the wild at any given moment.</p>\n\
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\
      <p>I don\xE2\x80\x99t view either one of these decisions as Google going back on the \xE2\x80\x9CAndroid is open source\xE2\x80\x9D mantra. One is just ensuring their best work is in the public repository, and the other is taking just a little more control over the operating system which really just means good things down the road with regards to OS updates and other things related to Android specifically. To me the idea is to bring things more in line to a single way of doing things rather than having a bunch of divergent paths for the Android operating system. The end result being less fragmentation, a single code base, and an overall better experience on Android.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Is that feature/idea absolutely essential to booking a show for your band?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      If the answer to that question was a \"No\" then we shelved the idea for possible later inclusion.  It might seem like a really weird idea to not build as many features as possible, but doing so keeps you on the path to actually launching your product.  If we hadn't followed that one simple rule when deciding where to focus our work, Erick and I would still be working on LiveShow and wouldn't have gotten it out the door.  If you don't ever release your product/application then you can never make money off of it. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/02/01/build-only-whats-necessary/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Erick and I set out to build <a title=\"LiveShow - Simple Booking Management to Help You Amplify Your Career\" href=\"http://www.booktheliveshow.com\">LiveShow</a>, we wrote down literally every idea that came to mind.  No matter how outrageous, complex, forward thinking, backwards thinking, or idiotic, if it was an idea related to booking shows we wrote it down.  When it came time to actually build the application, it became my job to keep us on the straight and narrow.  Because as we worked on the application, more ideas came to mind.</p>\n\
      <h3>Is it Absolutely Necessary</h3>\n\
      <p>Eventually it all came down to one simple question: Is that feature/idea absolutely essential to booking a show for your band?</p>\n\
      <p>If the answer to that question was a &#8220;No&#8221; then we shelved the idea for possible later inclusion. \xC2\xA0It might seem like a really weird idea to not build as many features as possible, but doing so keeps you on the path to actually launching your product. \xC2\xA0If we hadn&#8217;t followed that one simple rule when deciding where to focus our work, Erick and I would still be working on LiveShow and wouldn&#8217;t have gotten it out the door. \xC2\xA0If you don&#8217;t ever release your product/application then you can never make money off of it.</p>\n\
      <h3>Release Early, Release Often</h3>\n\
      <p>Creating an an application that runs and works on the internet means that you can release a product early and gradually add to its feature set as time passes. \xC2\xA0The phrase is often heard in what is known as the &#8220;agile development method&#8221; and it&#8217;s called &#8220;Release early, release often&#8221; and it means to release the product at the earliest possible point and then gradually improve it over time (have many successive releases).</p>\n\
      <p>If you want an example of a company that does this frequently, look no further than Google. \xC2\xA0A good example of Google doing this would be Gmail, their online email product. \xC2\xA0When Gmail was first released it allowed you to do 2 things with the emails you got: read them or archive them. \xC2\xA0There was no &#8220;delete&#8221; button because Gmail gave users one gigabyte of space, compared to Yahoo and Hotmail which gave around 250 megabytes of storage, that was a lot of space. \xC2\xA0They believed you&#8217;d never need to delete an email again. \xC2\xA0Over time they found that customers really wanted to be able to delete so they added a delete button, and then they add a &#8220;Trash&#8221; folder so you could recover accidentally deleted emails. \xC2\xA0They also over time added Google Talk to Gmail. \xC2\xA0And more recently they added the ability to make phone calls from within Gmail. \xC2\xA0Gmail is just one example of Google doing this. \xC2\xA0Android is another example, so is Google Calendar.</p>\n\
      <p>The idea is to get your product out in front of the public. \xC2\xA0Even if it doesn&#8217;t have all the features you&#8217;d want it to have, if it at least accomplishes the basic goal of the application then it&#8217;s good enough to launch with. \xC2\xA0Just because you launch it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s done. \xC2\xA0You can still make changes, add features, and fix bugs. \xC2\xA0Getting the product out in front of people allows you to figure out how people will use your application. \xC2\xA0You might find that they use it in a way that you hadn&#8217;t foreseen and that might give you a whole new direction to go in (read about Flickr&#8217;s early beginnings for a good example of this).</p>\n\
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\
      <p>When you start to build something, ask yourself what is the absolute essential things your product needs to allow users to achieve their goals. \xC2\xA0If a feature or idea isn&#8217;t a part of that, then shelve it for later. \xC2\xA0You want to get the product out to the public so they can use it, not keep it to yourself until it&#8217;s &#8220;perfect&#8221; because realistically it will never be perfect. \xC2\xA0Get it out there.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Do you say something like \"Man it would be great is someone would create a site that does [fill in the blank]\" a lot?  Do you find yourself coming up with great ideas only to forget them a couple of hours later?  Have you ever told an idea to your friends, have them tell you it's horrible, only to see the exact product a year later released by someone else?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Well, do something about it. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/01/31/thinking-of-starting-a-web-business-you-can-do-it/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you say something like &#8220;Man it would be great is someone would create a site that does [fill in the blank]&#8221; a lot? \xC2\xA0Do you find yourself coming up with great ideas only to forget them a couple of hours later? \xC2\xA0Have you ever told an idea to your friends, have them tell you it&#8217;s horrible, only to see the exact product a year later released by someone else?</p>\n\
      <p>Well, do something about it.</p>\n\
      <h3>Write Your Ideas Down</h3>\n\
      <p>Have a great idea? \xC2\xA0Write it down. \xC2\xA0In a notebook, in <a title=\"Evernote\" href=\"http://www.evernote.com\">Evernote</a> (or <a title=\"SpringPad\" href=\"http://springpadit.com/\">SpringPad</a>), on a napkin that you put in your pocket, write the idea down. \xC2\xA0Basically store it somewhere that you won&#8217;t lose it later. \xC2\xA0If you write the idea down, you can come back to it later. \xC2\xA0I can&#8217;t tell you the number of ideas I let slip away because I had this great idea while I was at work and didn&#8217;t write it down. \xC2\xA0So I started carrying a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8883701143?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=almosnotyet-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=8883701143\">notebook</a> (Amazon affiliate link) around. \xC2\xA0When I have an idea, I stop and write it in my notebook on one of the pages dedicated to business ideas. \xC2\xA0This allows me to easily find it later. \xC2\xA0If I don&#8217;t have the notebook with me for some reason, I open up Evernote (web page or application) and write it down in a note that is specific to my business ideas. \xC2\xA0Sure it means I have to look in two places when I&#8217;m reviewing those ideas, but at least I don&#8217;t forget the idea.</p>\n\
      <p>Don&#8217;t just write down the idea. \xC2\xA0Write down anything related to it. \xC2\xA0For example, I once had an idea to give companies the ability to create their own secure chat server, so I wrote the idea down, but I also wrote down to look at cloud computing options that would allow me to start and stop servers as needed, chat server software, protocols, and so on. \xC2\xA0That way I just didn&#8217;t write down the idea but also the surrounding ideas so I knew what direction I wanted to go.</p>\n\
      <h3>Pick An Idea</h3>\n\
      <p>After you&#8217;ve gotten a few ideas written down, spend a Saturday reviewing them. \xC2\xA0Flesh them out a little. \xC2\xA0What do you need to implement those ideas? \xC2\xA0What things should you research more? \xC2\xA0Which one really gets you fired up? \xC2\xA0If you find that an idea sparks a million other thoughts about that idea, go with it. \xC2\xA0If you aren&#8217;t passionate about it, you&#8217;re probably not going to get very far with it. \xC2\xA0However, if you find that a specific idea really gets your brain going, focus on it. \xC2\xA0It&#8217;s really about passion. \xC2\xA0You&#8217;re going to have to really like that idea to be able to spend the next year or so working on it.</p>\n\
      <h3>Keep it Simple</h3>\n\
      <p>That idea that&#8217;s spawning a million thoughts a second, that&#8217;s good. \xC2\xA0But don&#8217;t let yourself get carried away with all those secondary ideas. \xC2\xA0Write them down so you don&#8217;t lose them to the ether. \xC2\xA0Instead, after you&#8217;ve written them down go ahead and pick the absolute essentials. \xC2\xA0For every sub-idea, ask &#8220;is this absolutely essential to accomplishing the initial idea&#8221; and if the answer is &#8220;no&#8221; then move onto the next sub-idea. \xC2\xA0This will help you determine what&#8217;s really important to the idea. \xC2\xA0The ideas that aren&#8217;t absolutely essential can be worked on/implemented after launch.</p>\n\
      <p><strong>This is important</strong>: If it&#8217;s not absolutely essential to the achieve the goal of your product, you don&#8217;t need it to launch.</p>\n\
      <h3>Build It</h3>\n\
      <p>This is one of the most important thing to do. \xC2\xA0Build it. \xC2\xA0Get working on it as soon as you can. \xC2\xA0You&#8217;ll hit road blocks, have burn out, and have to put some time in during your off hours. \xC2\xA0But if you don&#8217;t build it, you can&#8217;t release it. \xC2\xA0Set up a schedule to work on the project. \xC2\xA0A couple of hours a day, no less than three days a week. \xC2\xA0Having such a schedule really helps you to set aside time for the project but still allow you to have a life. \xC2\xA0Having a life outside of work and your side project will delay any burn out experience you&#8217;re likely to have.</p>\n\
      <p>When you do hit a period of burn out, work on something else related to the project. \xC2\xA0Don&#8217;t have the website design, work on that. \xC2\xA0Formulate plans for after the launch of the product. \xC2\xA0Organize the to-do list or write a blog post about what you&#8217;re working on or some of the lessons learned so far. \xC2\xA0These things help you get through the burn outs but allow you to maintain momentum and your work schedule.</p>\n\
      <h3>Release It</h3>\n\
      <p>This is probably the most important part of the whole process. \xC2\xA0Getting it out to the public. \xC2\xA0Letting real users hack away and break things. \xC2\xA0Hey, thinks are going to break, accept this truth early on and you will be less stressed about it. \xC2\xA0But releasing your product means you completed the process. \xC2\xA0You took an idea from inception all the way to release. \xC2\xA0Sure you probably hit some snags along the way. \xC2\xA0It probably took you a little longer than you initially thought (it always does). \xC2\xA0But, it&#8217;s released, it&#8217;s out there.</p>\n\
      <p>Unfortunately, just releasing the product isn&#8217;t enough. \xC2\xA0You&#8217;ll need to make enhancements. \xC2\xA0Those ideas I said you need to put to the side because they&#8217;re not essential, start cherry picking those and working on them. \xC2\xA0You&#8217;ll have bugs to fix. \xC2\xA0There will be customers to support, they&#8217;re going to request things. \xC2\xA0Getting here though is the just the start of the journey. \xC2\xA0If you can get to this point, you&#8217;ve made it farther than most.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>If you use the Vim editor (or one of it&amp;#8217;s counterparts like gVim), use the RubyTest Vim Plugin, and you use RSpec for some of your testing then you might run into a problem that I was experiencing where it &amp;#8230; &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/01/29/vim-rubytest-and-rspec/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\

      </pre>\n\
      <p>Well, since I use RSpec 2.x (since I&#8217;m just now starting to use RSpec), the above error is quite annoying because the &#8216;spec&#8217; command isn&#8217;t really used anymore (at least from what I can find on the internet). \xC2\xA0So to get the RubyTest plugin to work with RSpec (and the &#8216;rspec&#8217; command) you have to make a small change the plugin as marked below via a diff.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Over the course of 2010 I spent most of my off time working on my side project, Just for Bands.  Specifically the first application to come from Just for Bands known as LiveShow.  The LiveShow application was written in Ruby on Rails with the plan to deploy it to Heroku (a successful plan I might add).  But the main point of this post is the idea of doing Test Driven Development (or TDD) in Ruby on Rails and how it allowed my partner and I to build an app quickly. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/01/28/testing-in-rails-its-important/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of 2010 I spent most of my off time working on my side project, <a title=\"Just for Bands\" href=\"http://www.justforbands.com\">Just for Bands</a>. \xC2\xA0Specifically the first application to come from Just for Bands known as LiveShow. \xC2\xA0The <a title=\"LiveShow - Simple Booking Management to Help Amplify Your Career\" href=\"http://www.booktheliveshow.com\">LiveShow</a> application was written in Ruby on Rails with the plan to deploy it to Heroku (a successful plan I might add). \xC2\xA0But the main point of this post is the idea of doing Test Driven Development (or TDD) in <a title=\"Ruby on Rails\" href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org\">Ruby on Rails</a> and how it allowed my partner and I to build an app quickly.</p>\n\
      <h3>Testing is Built In</h3>\n\
      <p>Something to know about testing frameworks and Ruby on Rails, there&#8217;s one built in. \xC2\xA0The built in testing framework in Ruby on Rails is Test::Unit. \xC2\xA0There are other frameworks that you can substitute in place of Test::Unit, but as far as &#8220;out of the box&#8221; frameworks go, you could do worse. \xC2\xA0Having a framework built in allowed me to teach Erick (my partner, who had never worked in Rails before) how to follow the TDD workflow: Write test, run test (seeing it fail), write minimal code to make test pass, see test pass, <strong>refactor</strong> (bold because people tend to forget this step). \xC2\xA0Erick had never done test driven development before, and I had never used Test::Unit (or written a Ruby on Rails app) before, so sticking with the built in framework allowed us to minimize the number of things we needed to learn from the get go.</p>\n\
      <h3>Delegation of Responsibilities</h3>\n\
      <p>Erick and I had a pretty strict division of responsibilities with regards to the work needed on the application. \xC2\xA0Since I&#8217;ve been developing code professionally for almost a decade, I was the developer. \xC2\xA0Erick was the sweeper, going between design and development duties where ever needed. \xC2\xA0And we hired a graphic designer, John to handle the more complex design work. \xC2\xA0Having such divisions allowed us to separate out the work. \xC2\xA0But it left me in a position where I felt I couldn&#8217;t develop a ton of code because I didn&#8217;t have any screens to wire up. \xC2\xA0This came from a lack of deep understanding of the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern that Rails is based on. \xC2\xA0To keep it quick, this pattern means there&#8217;s separation between the UI, data, and processing layers.</p>\n\
      <h3>Testing Allows Coding Without The User Interface</h3>\n\
      <p>Because the MVC pattern is designed with separation of various application elements in mind, I was able to develop the backend code without any screens. \xC2\xA0The idea of testing functionality as you develop using the built in test framework allowed most of the major functionality to be written and built while the design was worked out else where. \xC2\xA0This was crucial to our ability to get the product built and launched in one year&#8217;s time, while learning new languages and tools. \xC2\xA0Once the functionality was done, it was just a matter of tying it together with the user interface once we had a design we were happy with. \xC2\xA0Of course there were things that didn&#8217;t work quite like expected when we got the interface wired up, but it was less work than doing it from scratch, and having to wait would have meant delaying the product.</p>\n\
      <p>Also, with the tests we were able to see if it was the UI not working correctly or if it was really our functionality. \xC2\xA0In a couple of places we were testing for the wrong thing, or had an error in our test that caused a false positive. \xC2\xA0But those were much quicker to iron out with the tests in place. \xC2\xA0Having unit tested as we developed, we were able to save tons of time on the backend of the project fixing bugs.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>With the launch of LiveShow by Just for Bands last week, the stress of getting something done and pushed for public consumption is only half done.  Having actually \"shipped\" a working product, I understand that it is the larger (and harder) half. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/01/10/ship-it/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://www.booktheliveshow.com\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1600\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" title=\"LiveShow\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ad-liveshow.jpg\" alt=\"LiveShow\" width=\"205\" height=\"125\" /></a>With the launch of <a title=\"LiveShow - Just for Bands\" href=\"http://www.booktheliveshow.com\">LiveShow</a> by <a title=\"Just for Bands\" href=\"http://www.justforbands.com\">Just for Bands</a> last week, the stress of getting something done and pushed for public consumption is only half done. \xC2\xA0Having actually &#8220;shipped&#8221; a working product, I understand that it is the larger (and harder) half.</p>\n\
      <p>LiveShow took about 2 hours a night 4-5 nights a week for an entire year to get ready. \xC2\xA0The idea was always to get a basic product that did just what was needed to accomplish the goal done and pushed out for people to use. \xC2\xA0Yes, we occasionally got burned out. \xC2\xA0Yes, some things didn&#8217;t go quite as planned. \xC2\xA0Yes, we got behind sometimes. \xC2\xA0But we met our goal and launched within a year&#8217;s timeframe. \xC2\xA0What was the secret? \xC2\xA0We didn&#8217;t stop. \xC2\xA0If we got burned out we worked on other aspects, brainstormed, and generally found busy work that needed to be done.</p>\n\
      <p>But the real secret comes from the time boxing. \xC2\xA0Saying to ourselves nightly &#8220;I have 2 hours, I want to have [Feature X] working by then&#8221; and then working towards that. \xC2\xA0The feature being worked on could have just been one piece of a larger feature. \xC2\xA0But time boxing allowed us to really focus on what we were working on. \xC2\xA0When you have a seriously limited amount of time, it helps decide what needs to be worked on. \xC2\xA0On several occasions I scrapped my work and started fresh the next night because something took me longer than 2 hours during the first go. \xC2\xA0Most of the time, I was doing it wrong to begin with, but I had to do it wrong to find the right way and those couple of hours that might have seemed like a waste were actual pivotal in finding a solution that worked (and in many places more elegant).</p>\n\
      <p>Time boxing also allowed us to maintain family and social obligations. \xC2\xA0We started this project with our own time, our own money, and had to learn a few things on the way. \xC2\xA0We didn&#8217;t quit our day jobs and we certainly couldn&#8217;t deprive our families of our time. \xC2\xA0Time boxing allowed us to maintain a normal life. \xC2\xA0Sure we worked a little more than usual after hours, but the focus that time boxing allows and the fact that we limited our time allowed us to not get carried away.</p>\n\
      <p>If you&#8217;re looking to do your own side project, I recommend time boxing yourself to a couple of hours a night 3-5 nights a week. \xC2\xA0This will allow you to be moving constantly towards your goal without taking over your life. \xC2\xA0It certainly worked for Erick and I when working on LiveShow, and it&#8217;s one of the tent pole points of <a title=\"Getting Real from 37Signals\" href=\"http://gettingreal.37signals.com/\">37Signals&#8217; book &#8220;Getting Real&#8221;</a>. \xC2\xA0Give it shot, you have nothing to lose.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Yep,  today my partner Erick and I announced that LiveShow, the first Just for Bands app was ready for the world's viewing.  It took a year's worth of programming time at home after work and on weekends, learning a new programming language, learning a new web framework for writing web applications, designing a data model, and figuring out where the app should live.  But, it's officially shipped as of today around 1:30pm. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/01/03/liveshow-ships/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\

      <p>What is LiveShow? \xC2\xA0Simply, it&#8217;s a communication manager for bands that lets them track what band members are talking to what venues with regards to booking live shows (concerts, gigs, etc). \xC2\xA0The idea was simplicity. \xC2\xA0Get people in and out quickly so they can move on to other tasks. \xC2\xA0No one wants to sit and organize communications, add things to a calendar, set reminders, and so on. \xC2\xA0LiveShow does it automatically. \xC2\xA0As the user logs a communication with a potential venue, LiveShow will automatically set a reminder and the user will be emailed about the follow up when it&#8217;s time.</p>\n\
      <p>This was my first time doing a project from the ground up and as the main technical person who was in charge of backend design, coding practices, and development tools used so I&#8217;ll be spending some time over the next few blog posts going talking about some of the decisions we made from a technical standpoint, so keep an eye out for those if you&#8217;re interested. \xC2\xA0With this post, I officially enter the &#8220;start up&#8221; world, and become an entrepreneur. \xC2\xA0Hopefully good times are ahead.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>If you're ever had the privilege of reading \"Pragmatic Programmers\" then you know that they recommend that programmers learn at least one new language a year.   Around this time last year, I made the decision to begin following that practice and chose Ruby/Ruby on Rails as my programming language for 2010.  While not directly related to my day job, I wanted to build something in the language.  With the help of my friend we were able to build Just for Bands in Ruby on Rails, both learning the language as we went along. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/10/04/learning-a-programming-language-a-year-a-plan/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1586\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"The Pragmatic Programmer\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/PragProg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"265\" height=\"333\" />If you&#8217;re ever had the\xC2\xA0privilege\xC2\xA0of reading &#8220;The Pragmatic Programmer&#8221; then you know that they recommend that programmers learn at least one new language a year. \xC2\xA0 Around this time last year, I made the decision to begin following that practice and chose Ruby/Ruby on Rails as my programming language for 2010. \xC2\xA0While not directly related to my day job, I wanted to build something in the language. \xC2\xA0With the help of my friend we were able to build our first\xC2\xA0<a title=\"Just for Bands\" href=\"http://www.justforbands.com\">Just for Bands</a> web application\xC2\xA0in Ruby on Rails (<a title=\"Just for Bands: LiveShow\" href=\"http://www.booktheliveshow.com\">LiveShow</a>), both learning the language as we went along. \xC2\xA0While I&#8217;m still by no means a Ruby/Rails expert, I do feel some what comfortable enough with the framework. \xC2\xA0I still have to look up how to do things in Ruby, but this is just the side effect of learning a language. \xC2\xA0You&#8217;ll almost never know everything about a language.</p>\n\
      <h3>Observation</h3>\n\
      <p>I believe that part of the problem is that I&#8217;m not surrounded by other Ruby/Rails programmers and doing that kind of work on day to day basis. \xC2\xA0I spent 5 years in a C# office and thus was able to learn C# pretty well, and when I left that shop to better pursue programming, I was surround by &#8220;better&#8221; C# programmers that taught me even more. \xC2\xA0I believe that I would be better at Ruby today (not having to look as many things up) if I was in an environment that was utilizing the language (and/or Rails framework) on a daily basis.</p>\n\
      <h3>The Plan</h3>\n\
      <p>I plan to continue in my attempt to learn a new language every year. \xC2\xA0Upon\xC2\xA0further\xC2\xA0reading of several blog posts, I came across one that suggested that not only learning a new language but to also rotate the paradigms behind the language you learn (object oriented, dynamic, functional, etc). \xC2\xA0This not only allows you to learn a new language but also new concepts and new ways of thinking about problems because a functional language requires a very different thought process than dynamic one.</p>\n\
      <p>So with that in mind, here&#8217;s what my language plan looks like over the next few years:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n\
      <li>Oct &#8211; Dec 2010: Ruby</li>\n\
      <li>2011: Clojure</li>\n\
      <li>2012: C</li>\n\
      </ul>\n\
      <p>I went with <a title=\"Clojure\" href=\"http://clojure.org/\">Clojure</a> for a couple of reasons. \xC2\xA0The first being that it&#8217;s a functional language. \xC2\xA0Secondly, it&#8217;s not tied to the Microsoft .NET platform (like F#). \xC2\xA0While I&#8217;ve heard and seen good things about F#, I wanted to keep the Microsoft stack strictly a day-job thing. \xC2\xA0Plus Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine, so it can really run on any machine that runs Java. \xC2\xA0Finally, going with Clojure will bring some experience with <a title=\"Lisp Programming Language\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)\">Lisp</a>, since Clojure is very Lisp like. \xC2\xA0This will bring me at least a smidging of experience with using Lisp, without actually having to learn Lisp.</p>\n\
      <p>As for C, some would argue that the C programming language is a &#8220;functional&#8221; language. \xC2\xA0And while there is truth in that point of view, I personally view C as &#8220;systems language&#8221; (something used to write drivers, operating systems, etc). \xC2\xA0Learning C is also a personal mission of mine, and one that I&#8217;ve had since \xC2\xA0was 15 and never just banged it out. \xC2\xA0Something else always came up.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>What is Just for Bands?  Just for Bands is a side project I started with a very close friend of mine, Erick Wilson.  The idea came about because Erick wanted to find a set of online tools to help him and his band handle certain band management related activities.  I told him, that we should instead write our own since we know what bands go through and what kind of stuff we can eliminate to make the process efficient and streamlined. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/09/26/just-for-bands-launches/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\

      \t\t<description>Yep, I broke down and finally bought a Kindle.  The latest generation of the Kindle just finally sold me on getting one.  The price was right, and the recent changes to the overall design were nice too.  Why did I get a Kindle over the \"magical\" Apple iPad?  One reason, I wanted a device specifically for reading.  Sure you can read books on the iPad, but it's a brightly lit LCD screen, plus the iPad is a little weighty.  The iPad is a nice device for what it is, but for something to read long term on, it really isn't up to snuff.  I wanted to read books and I wanted it to have a true page like feel to what I was looking at. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/09/25/got-a-kindle/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://www.kindle.com\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1573\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Amazon Kindle\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/kindle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"270\" height=\"378\" /></a>Yep, I broke down and finally bought a Kindle. \xC2\xA0The latest generation of the Kindle just finally sold me on getting one. \xC2\xA0The price was right, and the recent changes to the overall design were nice too. \xC2\xA0Why did I get a Kindle over the &#8220;magical&#8221; Apple iPad? \xC2\xA0One reason, I wanted a device specifically for reading. \xC2\xA0Sure you can read books on the iPad, but it&#8217;s a brightly lit LCD screen, plus the iPad is a little weighty. \xC2\xA0The iPad is a nice device for what it is, but for something to read long term on, it really isn&#8217;t up to snuff. \xC2\xA0I wanted to read books and I wanted it to have a true page like feel to what I was looking at.</p>\n\
      <h3>Initial Impressions</h3>\n\
      <p>When I first took the Kindle out of its box and turned it on, I was immediately impressed with how the screen looks. \xC2\xA0Instantly I could tell that the eInk screen was going to serve the purpose it was meant to serve with little trouble. \xC2\xA0It really felt like reading off of a page with ink on it rather than reading a digital screen. \xC2\xA0The contrast on the latest Kindle devices is very nice as well. \xC2\xA0When I first put the Kindle into standby and saw one of the screen saver images that came on the screen, I was instantly impressed with the image quality. \xC2\xA0Sure, it was in black and white, but it was a very nicely defined black and white.</p>\n\
      <p>Since I had previously used the Kindle app on my iPhone and my current Android device, I already had some Kindle books purchased and waiting to be downloaded. \xC2\xA0Navigating to my archived books and downloading them was simple enough, even if the refresh rate on the eInk screen doesn&#8217;t make for a wonky navigation experience. \xC2\xA0It&#8217;s almost like it redraws the screen everytime you do something (this is probably actually what it&#8217;s doing, I&#8217;d have to read more on eInk to be sure). \xC2\xA0However, the wonkiness doesn&#8217;t completely detract from the overall user experience for basic reading and usage of the device. \xC2\xA0Where it&#8217;s really\xC2\xA0noticeable\xC2\xA0that this screen was not mean to do much more than show something closely resembling a printed page is when you try to use the Kindle&#8217;s built in web browser. \xC2\xA0That&#8217;s when the user experience can go way wrong. \xC2\xA0This device was meant to read books, not surf the net.</p>\n\
      <h3>Reading Books</h3>\n\
      <p>You buy a Kindle to read books on. \xC2\xA0That&#8217;s it. \xC2\xA0It&#8217;s not an all in one device like the iPad. \xC2\xA0So getting Kindle means you kind of hope that it will work for reading books quite well. \xC2\xA0I&#8217;m happy to say that just from this past week of using the Kindle it definitely handles the task of being easy to read off of. \xC2\xA0I&#8217;m officially convinced that the Kindle will do for books what the iPod did for music and it will become\xC2\xA0synonymous\xC2\xA0with electronic books the same way the iPod became synonymous with digital music. \xC2\xA0It just does the job so well. \xC2\xA0I&#8217;ve played with the Nook and the Sony eReaders and the experience with the Kindle just feels better overall. \xC2\xA0While the Sony eReaders are nice, my initial experience with the Kindle in the same time span as with the Sony eReaders was just a better, more pleasant experience. \xC2\xA0This might partially be due to the Kindle&#8217;s WhisperSync that allowed me to get books onto the device without having to plug into a computer.</p>\n\
      <h3>Conclusions</h3>\n\
      <p>I have to say that the Kindle presents me with the nice opportunity to carry around some books to read, without having to carry the physical books. \xC2\xA0This means a lighter bag to carry and less bulk when actually reading. \xC2\xA0The Kindle is a joy to hold in my hand and reading off the screen is nice. \xC2\xA0Overall, I was impressed and ultimately satisfied with my purchase.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>While having a discussion with a friend of mine earlier today about how I would tell if programming candidate was up to snuff, I realized that a lot of programmers out there are probably missing a lot of chances to get better jobs, find more work (if they're a contractor), or just a simple learning opportunity by not having their source code for their personal programming projects stored in an online code repository.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/09/21/get-your-source-code-online/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While having a discussion with a friend of mine earlier today about how I would tell if programming candidate was up to snuff, I realized that a lot of programmers out there are probably missing a lot of chances to get better jobs, find more work (if they&#8217;re a contractor), or just a simple learning opportunity by not having their source code for their personal programming projects stored in an online code repository. \xC2\xA0With online code repositories like <a title=\"GitHub\" href=\"http://www.github.com\">GitHub</a>, <a title=\"Google Code\" href=\"http://code.google.com\">Google Code</a>, or <a title=\"CodePlex\" href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/\">CodePlex</a>, there is no excuse for a developer to not have the source code to their personal projects stored online. \xC2\xA0GitHub even gives you the option to pay for an account that will allow you store some projects online privately.</p>\n\
      <p>A good developer already knows that using source control is a good practice that every developer should be following regularly. \xC2\xA0So using a online source control repository, means that not only are you doing source control but you also have an offline copy of all your code. \xC2\xA0If you computer was to ever crash, then getting back to where you left off isn&#8217;t nearly as difficult than having to start from scratch.</p>\n\
      <p>But one important aspect that doing this buys you, is when you&#8217;re talking to potential employer (or client), and they ask for code samples (as any good interviewer, interviewing people for a programming position should do) you&#8217;ll be able to point them at your repositories to allow them to peruse through and see what kind of work you can do. \xC2\xA0Seeing someone&#8217;s code can really help a good developer interviewer see how a potential employee thinks out problems and organizes solutions to those problems. \xC2\xA0This can be an important first step towards determining if the interviewee has some skill.</p>\n\
      <p>The downside is that a nice looking code repository can be faked. \xC2\xA0A good interviewer will know what questions to ask and what answers to look for when asking about the solutions presented in your code repositories. \xC2\xA0If they still have doubts, they could ask you (the interviewee) to take a coding test, but hey if you&#8217;re as good as you&#8217;re presenting to the interviewers then that should be cake, right?</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Google released Instant Search earlier this week.  It's a pretty spiffy piece of technology, if you're logged into your Google account and go to the Google search page, and start typing in a search, the screen will shift to show you results in an almost real time manner. Over the last few days, you hear a lot of tech pundits talking about how Google wasted it's time, because no one uses the Google search page anymore, they use the search bar in their browser.  So Google has spent time on a problem that doesn't really exist.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I disagree.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/09/12/google-instant-search/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google released Instant Search earlier this week.  It&#8217;s a pretty spiffy piece of technology, if you&#8217;re logged into your Google account and go to the Google search page, and start typing in a search, the screen will shift to show you results in an almost real time manner. Over the last few days, you hear a lot of tech pundits talking about how Google wasted it&#8217;s time, because no one uses the Google search page anymore, they use the search bar in their browser.  So Google has spent time on a problem that doesn&#8217;t really exist.</p>\n\
      <p>I disagree.  What I saw in Google&#8217;s new Instant Search is innovation in the search game.  While Bing (the only real competitor to Google since it also power&#8217;s Yahoo&#8217;s search engine) is still trying to catch up on cracking Google&#8217;s previous search algorithm and accuracy, Google brought out the next generation of search.  In other words, Google pretty much owns the search market, but they didn&#8217;t rest on their laurels (Internet Explorer anyone?).  Instead Google worked to create something that will now be an expectation of all things search within the next year or so.</p>\n\
      <p>The amount of infrastructure, architecture, database design, database programming, and so forth used to create Google Instant Search is a tremendous amount of smarts.  This is innovation is a computer science way rather than innovation in &#8220;lets solve a customer problem way&#8221; and while some would argue its the wrong focus, I&#8217;d argue that there is a place for both kinds of innovation in the tech world.  Things like the backend for Instant Search are important moves forward in solving the data problems of tomorrow.  We&#8217;re all sitting on large amounts of data, Facebook, Google, Twitter.  There are endless amounts of data there, and sense needs to be made of that data.</p>\n\
      <p>So before we start saying that Google isn&#8217;t solving a real problem, we need to think a little deeper than just a customer facing level.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Over the 3 day weekend I decided I was going to write a simple Android application to publish to the Android App Market to find out a few things.  First, I wanted to see if I could do it, write an app with some kind of simple functionality quickly.  Secondly, I wanted to see what the process for publishing to the Android App Market was like.  We hear all the time about how Apple disapproves apps, and kicks apps out of the market (sometimes almost, it would seem, randomly). &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/09/07/rotation-cipher-my-first-android-app/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the 3 day weekend I decided I was going to write a simple Android application to publish to the Android App Market to find out a few things. \xC2\xA0First, I wanted to see if I could do it, write an app with some kind of simple functionality quickly. \xC2\xA0Secondly, I wanted to see what the process for publishing to the Android App Market was like. \xC2\xA0We hear all the time about how Apple disapproves apps, and kicks apps out of the market (sometimes almost, it would seem, randomly).</p>\n\
      <p>I&#8217;m happy to say that I was successful. \xC2\xA0I wrote a simple rotation cipher application (rotation cipher is also commonly known as the\xC2\xA0Caesar\xC2\xA0Cipher). \xC2\xA0It took me a grand total of maybe 4 hours to write the code (most of it spent on getting the UI just right), and then literally 15 minutes to publish it to the App Market. \xC2\xA0The moment I hit the &#8220;Publish&#8221; button, I was able to open the Android App Market on my phone, do a search, and find my app. \xC2\xA0Now that&#8217;s quick.</p>\n\
      <p>If you want to download and mess with my app, but I promise is not really something to write home about, you can use the QR code below, or goto the <a title=\"Rotation Cipher on AppBrain\" href=\"http://www.appbrain.com/app/koby.rotationcipher\">AppBrain page</a> directly.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>My question is, why would you ignore an obvious, growing sector of the mobile market?  Yes, I understand that right now, Apple has the store that has on numerous occasions made people millions for simple applications.  However, that doesn't mean that the Android Marketplace or Windows Phone 7 Marketplace will not make you any money. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/06/22/why-ignore-some-mobile-platforms/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I say <a title=\"App Advice - Angry Birds\xE2\x80\x99 Publisher Refusing Offers From Microsoft, Google\" href=\"http://appadvice.com/appnn/2010/06/angry-birds-developer-refusing-offers-microsoft-google/\">this article</a>, about the publisher of the popular iPhone game &#8220;Angry Birds&#8221; refusing offers from Microsoft and Google to write games for Windows Phone 7 and Android mobile operating systems. \xC2\xA0I&#8217;ve seen other people tweet similar things, usually saying things along the lines of &#8220;we won&#8217;t be writing Android apps any time soon&#8221; and similar quips.</p>\n\
      <p>My question is, why would you ignore an obvious, growing sector of the mobile market? \xC2\xA0Yes, I understand that right now, Apple has the store that has on numerous occasions made people millions for simple applications. \xC2\xA0However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that the Android Marketplace or Windows Phone 7 Marketplace will not make you any money.</p>\n\
      <p>We have developers who are making it a public point to not write applications for non-iPhone devices. \xC2\xA0Which to mean, from a business standpoint is a poor decision. \xC2\xA0I have no problems with writing the iPhone app first and getting it to market. \xC2\xA0People think iPhone when they think mobile app, so I get that you have to have an iPhone app to have mobile exposure. \xC2\xA0I understand this, I really do. \xC2\xA0But to say, well I see this other mobile OS (Android) is gaining market share, but I&#8217;m going to ignore it and only focus on the iPhone.</p>\n\
      <p>The only time that people seem to look at mobile application alternatives is when their app gets dumped from the iPhone App Store. \xC2\xA0You see it all the time, &#8220;Our app was removed for no reason&#8221; and while Steve Jobs has recently made it a point to say why most apps are removed, rejected from the store, we all know there are apps that shouldn&#8217;t have been rejected (Google Voice App anyone?). \xC2\xA0But again, this is the only time that people start looking at alternative avenues for mobile development. \xC2\xA0Wouldn&#8217;t a smart business plan be to have your app on as many platforms as possible? \xC2\xA0I know that I&#8217;d want to maximize my revenue streams, but some people seem to be okay with ignoring anything that isn&#8217;t the iPhone.</p>\n\
      <p>What are your thoughts on this? \xC2\xA0I&#8217;d really like to hear why some are choosing to ignore Android and Windows Phone 7 for their apps. \xC2\xA0Because to me it just seems like poor business. \xC2\xA0But hey, I could be wrong.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>It had to happen eventually. Twitter for iPhone (previously known as Tweetie 2) is one of the best Twitter apps for the iPhone. \xC2\xA0It&amp;#8217;s jammed packed with features but with some really nice UI elements that don&amp;#8217;t give you that &amp;#8230; &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/06/17/seesmic-for-iphone/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://www.seesmic.com\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1557\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Seesmic\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/seesmic-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"202\" height=\"201\" /></a>It had to happen eventually. <a title=\"Twitter for iPhone (iTunes link)\" href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8\"> Twitter for iPhone</a> (previously known as Tweetie 2) is one of the best Twitter apps for the iPhone. \xC2\xA0It&#8217;s jammed packed with features but with some really nice UI elements that don&#8217;t give you that feeling of overload. \xC2\xA0But a couple of weeks back I switched to using <a title=\"Seesmic for iPhone\" href=\"http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/\">Seesmic for the iPhone</a> just to try it out. \xC2\xA0I don&#8217;t see myself going back anytime soon. \xC2\xA0Even though I miss some of the nicer UI elements of Twitter for iPhone, Seesmic is a nice app that actually allows me to use it to replace 2 apps with it on my front screen.</p>\n\
      <h3>It&#8217;s Twitter, it&#8217;s Facebook, it&#8217;s BOTH</h3>\n\
      <p>The first thing I noticed when I fired up Seesmic for the first time was that it handled <a title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com\">Twitter</a> and Facebook. \xC2\xA0Initial thoughts included &#8220;well if this can do <a title=\"Facebook\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a> too, well I might be able to move Facebook off my front screen too&#8221; and while the Facebook implementation isn&#8217;t 100 percent, it is definitely good enough that I can use it 98% of the time.</p>\n\
      <p>Seesmic for iPhone also handles Twitter searches and lists. \xC2\xA0It has a nice interface that allows for separation of the various lists and networks that doesn&#8217;t come off as cluttered (the way TweetDeck for iPhone did for me). \xC2\xA0With Seesmic, I&#8217;m able to switch between my Twitter timeline, Facebook news feed, and various lists/searches.</p>\n\
      <h3>Navigation</h3>\n\
      <p>One of the cooler things I like about Seesmic is that to navigate between Twitter, Facebook, Ping.FM, and various Twitter lists and searches is that I simply have to swipe left/right depending on where I am in my &#8220;tabs&#8221; (or tiles). \xC2\xA0However this means that the Twitter for iPhone feature that allows you to swipe a tweet is gone (this was one of my favorite features of Twitter for iPhone). \xC2\xA0Even though it means I lose a feature, this one feature makes Seesmic extremely efficient. \xC2\xA0I can jump between accounts and lists with the greatest of ease. \xC2\xA0When I pick up my iPhone to check Twitter, I&#8217;m almost always going to check Facebook too, now I can do it in one app and with just a small swipe of the finger.</p>\n\
      <p>I have to say though that I do find myself missing the Twitter for iPhone tweet swipe shortcut for replying and favoriting tweets. \xC2\xA0On Seesmic this is at least 2 screen presses, and while that might not seem like much, coming from the official Twitter app it just feels clunky. \xC2\xA0However, I understand the reason this can&#8217;t be done in Seesmic and do not overly fault them for it. \xC2\xA0They mad an UI decision and theirs works and is quite efficient, just in a different way and for a different purpose.</p>\n\
      <h3>Overall</h3>\n\
      <p>Overall, I think I&#8217;ll probably keep Seesmic on my front screen for a good while longer than originally anticipated. \xC2\xA0That&#8217;s saying something because I&#8217;ve tried a lot of iPhone Twitter apps and not a single one was able to dethrone Tweetie (as it was known at the time). \xC2\xA0I still thing Twitter for iPhone is a fantastic product and if you&#8217;re looking for a good Twitter app, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find one better. \xC2\xA0I wouldn&#8217;t say that, in the end, Seesmic is better than Twitter for iPhone but it does have certain features for a &#8220;power user&#8221; that can clear some icons off the front screen. \xC2\xA0If you use both Twitter and Facebook with extreme regularity then you need to be taking a hard look at Seesmic for iPhone.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>With the recent announcement of the new iPhone 4, there's been a lot of talk about how it compares to the latest run of Android devices (HTC EVO, HTC Droid Incredible, and Nexus One).  However anytime someone brings up the Android elephant in the iPhone room, there's talk similar to \"oh well Android is fragmented\" or \"all those apps won't work on your phone\" and other similar phrases.  I want to spend some time today discussing this issue as I see it. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/06/16/android-and-the-fragmentation-fud/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1551\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" title=\"Android\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/android-robot-logo2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" height=\"264\" />With the recent announcement of the new iPhone 4, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk about how it compares to the latest run of Android devices (HTC EVO, HTC Droid Incredible, and Nexus One). \xC2\xA0However anytime someone brings up the Android elephant in the iPhone room, there&#8217;s talk similar to &#8220;oh well Android is fragmented&#8221; or &#8220;all those apps won&#8217;t work on your phone&#8221; and other similar phrases. \xC2\xA0I want to spend some time today discussing this issue as I see it.</p>\n\
      <h3>Yes it&#8217;s Fragmentation</h3>\n\
      <p>In the strictest definition of the word, the Android world is fragmented. \xC2\xA0You have a lot of devices all running different versions of the Android OS. \xC2\xA0Though Google and the OEMs have worked hard to lower the amount of fragmentation, it&#8217;s still there. \xC2\xA0If you want your app to cover as many devices as possible, you have to (currently) code for Android 1.6. \xC2\xA0With the recent announcement of 2.2, this seems like a poor call. \xC2\xA0Newer versions of Android have new functionality that would be\xC2\xA0beneficial to older phones. \xC2\xA0Specifically the ability to save apps onto the microSD card and keep it out of the onboard memory.</p>\n\
      <p>There is something to be said about the fact that Android is being developed at a fast rate that it&#8217;s hard for manufacturers to keep up. \xC2\xA0Not only is the underlying Android OS being developed at a rapid pace, but each manufacturer has it&#8217;s own variation of the OS. \xC2\xA0HTC has their Sense UI, Motorola has their MotoBLUR technology, and so on. \xC2\xA0Due to this, it takes longer for these manufacturers to release the updated OS versions because they have to put their own touches on the new version before they can push it out. \xC2\xA0In some cases they&#8217;ve decided not to do this.</p>\n\
      <p>The other issue is that a lot of the older Android 1.x devices had limited onboard ROM spaces, which makes updating to the newer OS even more complicated. \xC2\xA0So while this kind of fragmentation exists and it could be viewed as a bad thing, it&#8217;s not always.<span id=\"more-1549\"></span></p>\n\
      <h3>No, it&#8217;s Not Fragmentation</h3>\n\
      <p>Why is it not a bad thing? \xC2\xA0Because it&#8217;s constant improvement of the underlying operating system of the phone. \xC2\xA0Sure you might be on an older device that can&#8217;t update, but that means that they next Android phone you get is going to be better than the one you currently have. \xC2\xA0Before iPhone and Android, such a thing was unheard of. \xC2\xA0Mobile phone makers didn&#8217;t really worry about updating their mobile OS too much, because they didn&#8217;t have too. \xC2\xA0Now with Android, their finding that they need to stay bleeding edge to compete because people are starting to understand the game better.</p>\n\
      <p>Part of the reason for Android&#8217;s fast growth is Google&#8217;s understanding that they had to play catch up a little. \xC2\xA0I&#8217;m not one-sided here, when Android 1.0 came out it paled compared to the recently released iPhone OS 2.0. \xC2\xA0But Google didn&#8217;t rest and quickly pushed out new versions. \xC2\xA0Apple releases their iPhone OS once a year, currently Android is on 2 releases a year. \xC2\xA0They surpasses Apple this year (sorry fanboys, but it&#8217;s true). \xC2\xA0Android has had multitasking from day 1, we have over the air updates, and now over the air syncing. \xC2\xA0Also, the latest Android OS ran circles around both the iPad and the iPhone (with javascript no less, so it wasn&#8217;t even a native app). \xC2\xA0Most of what&#8217;s in iPhone OS 4.0 has been in Android for a while (heck even the multi-tasking is done in a similar manner).</p>\n\
      <p>One important thing to not overlook (again) is that Google is making manufacturers think about things like future software updates, and companies like HTC and Motorola are starting to get hip to the game of continual updates of the operating system. \xC2\xA0They might be slow on the delivery now, but with time we&#8217;ll see more releases and less lag. \xC2\xA0Before Apple and Android, this was unheard of. \xC2\xA0Manufacturers ignored the mobile OS because most people would just buy a new phone. \xC2\xA0Google is making manufacturers think about the mobile OS in the same way that Apple made the carriers think about data. \xC2\xA0After the iPhone data plans became something of a commodity, you got unlimited data at a set price. \xC2\xA0Now equipment makers are going to have think about their devices as something that last longer than that 2 year contract interval. \xC2\xA0Sure the geeks are still going to upgrade regularly, but the average joe isn&#8217;t going to care (they might not care about OS updates, but if their phone tells them there&#8217;s an update to install they&#8217;ll probably install it).</p>\n\
      <p>Google has said that they will eventually slow down the rate of Android releases in fight to\xC2\xA0alleviate\xC2\xA0the fragmentation. \xC2\xA0They understand it&#8217;s an issue, but they also know they need to keep improving their OS in order to hold the lead they now have over Apple.</p>\n\
      <h3>The Current State of Things</h3>\n\
      <p>The image below was posted on the <a title=\"Android Police - Fragmentation Boogeyman\" href=\"http://www.androidpolice.com/2010/06/01/google-update-platform-versions-chart-call-fragmentation-a-bogeyman/\">Android Police</a> website back in January (I tried to find a new infographic but was unable to do so).</p>\n\
      <div id=\"attachment_1550\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 727px\"><a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/android_versions_chart.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1550 \" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Android Version Chart\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/android_versions_chart-1024x317.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"717\" height=\"222\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Click to Enlarge</p></div>\n\
      <p>As you can see, the fragmentation is slowly\xC2\xA0dissipating. \xC2\xA0Many of the older 1.5 phones don&#8217;t have enough onboard memory to hold the new 2.x versions of Android. \xC2\xA0This is a hardware issue, not a software issue. \xC2\xA0Many of the remaining phones have seem recent announcements about upgrades to 2.x versions. \xC2\xA0By the end of the year, I predict that we&#8217;ll start seeing less phones that are not able to update to newer versions.</p>\n\
      <p>Also, there is an active community of Android developers who are working to get the newer versions of the operating system to be loadable on older phones. \xC2\xA0Of course this isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart and does require some hackery. \xC2\xA0But the ability is there.</p>\n\
      <h3>Things to Consider</h3>\n\
      <p>The issue of fragmentation is a two sided problem. \xC2\xA0It&#8217;s not just Google&#8217;s rapid development of the Android operating system but the manufacturers struggling to keep up. \xC2\xA0Some would argue (rightfully so) that this is where Apple&#8217;s success comes from. \xC2\xA0They couple their hardware and software so tightly together that they can really hone in on the perfection side of things. \xC2\xA0However, this is partially what has caused them to be surpassed by Android in both functionality soon number of available devices.</p>\n\
      <p>I&#8217;m not going to argue that the iPhone is subpar, it&#8217;s not. \xC2\xA0The iPhone is a superb device in a many aspects. \xC2\xA0Android has some nice devices out as well (see the Nexus One or the HTC EVO). \xC2\xA0But Apple isn&#8217;t the only game in the market anymore and Android, regardless of it&#8217;s fragmentation, is proving to be a good competitor. \xC2\xA0And competition is good. \xC2\xA0But I feel that we lose site of the advantages of the rapid development cycle, because there are advantages. \xC2\xA0Apple fanboys would like us to forget those however (and the Google fanboys would like to forget that Apple really does have a tendency to bring its &#8220;A&#8221; game).</p>\n\
      <p>All in all, the competition is a good thing. \xC2\xA0We&#8217;ll be seeing things improve on both ends and I truly believe that Android device makers will shorten the lag between new OS announcements and getting the updates to the phones. \xC2\xA0They&#8217;ll have to if they want to remain competitive.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>If you've known me for any length of time, you probably know that I highly encourage everyone to use a password vault of some kind. There are several good ones available some of them are free, other's cost money. Over the years I've tried several and the ones I've used the most are KeePass and more recently LastPass. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/05/06/my-thoughts-on-lastpass/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve known me for any length of time, you probably know that I highly encourage everyone to use a password vault of some kind.  There are several good ones available some of them are free, other&#8217;s cost money.  Over the years I&#8217;ve tried several and the ones I&#8217;ve used the most are <a href=\"http://www.keepass.info\">KeePass</a> and more recently <a title=\"LastPass\" href=\"http://www.lastpass.com\">LastPass</a>.</p>\n\
      <p>Yesterday, the internet was on fire over the <a href=\"http://blog.lastpass.com/2011/05/lastpass-security-notification.html\">possible intrusion to LastPass&#8217;s server</a>s (please read this as I feel it&#8217;s the proper way to handle such a situation). \xC2\xA0But I want to point out 2 things, which are mentioned in the article:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n\
      <li>LastPass is very clear in that they are not 100% sure something was breached</li>\n\
      <li>They did notice a traffic anomaly that they couldn&#8217;t explain</li>\n\
      </ol>\n\
      <p>These are very important points that need to be considered when it comes to using LastPass. \xC2\xA0But I want to give my thoughts since I actually use the service.</p>\n\
      <h2>Your Passwords Are Probably Safe</h2>\n\
      <p>One of the main arguments people give against LastPass is that it puts all your passwords in the cloud on their servers. \xC2\xA0While true, that&#8217;s not the full story. You can read their website where they <a href=\"https://lastpass.com/whylastpass_technology.php\">explain how it all works</a>, but I&#8217;ll give you the gist. Basically when you sign up for last pass, the vault for your passwords is created locally, encrypted, and then uploaded to their servers. \xC2\xA0They don&#8217;t have a way to unlock it on their end. You have to have your master password to be able to unlock anything around your LastPass vault.</p>\n\
      <p>On top of that, LastPass is giving everyone a set of options. A user can do any of the following:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n\
      <li>Change their master password</li>\n\
      <li>Not change their master password now, and be reminded to do so later</li>\n\
      <li>Take the risk and not change their master password</li>\n\
      </ol>\n\
      <p>By making people change their passwords, they&#8217;re attempting to negate any issue a possible intrusion might cause. \xC2\xA0If you have a really strong master password, then you&#8217;re probably okay (if your master password is &#8220;password&#8221; you&#8217;re doing it wrong).</p>\n\
      <p>Also, I think that LastPass handled this situation really well. They informed their users, and are requiring them to take action, even though all they found was a traffic\xC2\xA0anomaly, and not an actual breach. They are standing on the side of caution, and since they&#8217;re a password vault, that&#8217;s exactly what you should want them to do.</p>\n\
      <h2>What I&#8217;m Going to Do (and What You Should Do Too)</h2>\n\
      <p>I&#8217;m going to move to using two factor authentication with my LastPass account. \xC2\xA0What this means is that not only will I need my LastPass credentials (email address and password), but also some other way of authenticating myself to access my LastPass password vault. \xC2\xA0LastPass offers multiple options for this, and they should be researched to find one that works best for you.</p>\n\
      <p>However, other password vaults offer similar functionality. \xC2\xA0I know that KeePass offers this, but I&#8217;m not sure about <a href=\"http://agilebits.com/onepassword\">1Password</a>.</p>\n\
      <p>If you&#8217;re using a password vault, I would recommend moving to using two factor authentication. \xC2\xA0I would also recommend doing so for any site that offers the ability to use two factor authentication (Gmail and several banks offer this). \xC2\xA0Doing so helps lower the risk of you being compromised.</p>\n\
      <h2>Password Vaults</h2>\n\
      <p>Below is a list of password vaults. Please consider using one of these and start using secure passwords (and different passwords on different sites). \xC2\xA0Please note that outside of LastPass and KeePass I don&#8217;t know too much about the others.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>I recently spent some time setting up my *nix configuration files for Bash and VIM in a repository on Github. Since I used several git repositories for handling my various VIM plugins and color schemes, I utilized git\xE2\x80\x99s submodule functionality &amp;#8230; &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/05/02/using-git-submodules/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/250px-Git-logo.svg_.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Git Logo\" width=\"250\" height=\"96\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1644\" />I recently spent some time setting up my *nix configuration files for Bash and VIM in a <a href=\"http://www.github.com/mkoby/dotmatrix\">repository on Github</a>. Since I used several git repositories for handling my various VIM plugins and color schemes, I utilized git\xE2\x80\x99s submodule functionality to link to the original repositories, allowing me to keep the plugins up to date.  Today I want to look a little closer at <a href=\"http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html\">Git submodules</a> and how I\xE2\x80\x99m using them.</p>\n\
      <h2>Setting Up a Submodule</h2>\n\
      <p>Setting up a submodule in git, is actually fairly easy, you just pass in the repository address and the folder you want it to go to. So for example, on my VIM plugins, I use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails\">vim-rails plugin by Tim Pope</a>. So to create a git submodule off of this repository for the plugin I use the following:</p>\n\
      <pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ;\">\n\
      [~/git/dotmatrix]$ git submodule add \\\n\
      https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails.git \\\n\
      vim/bundle/vim-rails\n\
      </pre>\n\
      <p>This will create a \xE2\x80\x9Cvim-rails\xE2\x80\x9D folder in vim/bundle/ and then download the files from the repository. Meaning that when I commit and then push my dotmatrix repository, it will upload the information for the submodules into my repository on Github. When I set up a new computer, I simply install Git, and then run the following:</p>\n\
      <pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ;\">\n\
      [~/git]$ git clone \\\n\
      git@github.com:mkoby/dotmatrix.git --recursive\n\
      </pre>\n\
      <p>You\xE2\x80\x99ll note the \xE2\x80\x9C&#8211;recursive\xE2\x80\x9D argument, this is what tells git to first download the files for the repository and then recursively create the folders and download the files for the submodules.  I then run my setup script that sets up the various configuration files to their appropriate locations so that I\xE2\x80\x99m ready to code with just a few commands.</p>\n\
      <h2>Updating the Submodules</h2>\n\
      <p>Once you have the submodules, you have to update them from time to time. Maybe there\xE2\x80\x99s a bug fix, or maybe a new feature in your submodules. To update them is actually quite simple, you simply run the following command:</p>\n\
      <pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ;\">\n\
      [~/git/dotmatrix]$ git submodule foreach \\\n\
      \xE2\x80\x98git pull origin master\xE2\x80\x99\n\
      </pre>\n\
      <p>This goes through each submodule\xE2\x80\x99s folder and runs a regular \xE2\x80\x9Cgit pull\xE2\x80\x9D on the folder bringing in the latest changes. The \xE2\x80\x9Cforeach\xE2\x80\x9D argument is actually built into git\xE2\x80\x99s submodule functionality, so there is no hidden magic here.</p>\n\
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\
      <p>This is the primary place I\xE2\x80\x99m using Git\xE2\x80\x99s Submodule functionality, but this could be used to separate out various project files into separate repositories for better project organization. If anyone sees that I\xE2\x80\x99m doing something wrong, just let me know as I\xE2\x80\x99m always looking to improve my workflows.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>But good things always have to come to an end at some point and a new beginning must be made.

So as of today, I\xE2\x80\x99m not longer employed by Sogeti, and will be moving on to a stealth-startup here in Houston. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/04/29/moving-on-leaving-sogeti/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost four years ago, I left working for Prudential Real Estate Services to go work as a consultant Sogeti. The intent was to surround myself with programmers in hopes that I could learn to become a better programmer myself. I\xE2\x80\x99d like to say that the experiment was a success.  I met some really great people, who taught me a great many things. It wasn\xE2\x80\x99t all about the programming all the time, but I did get to work on tons of different projects, doing many different kinds of work.</p>\n\
      <p>But good things always have to come to an end at some point and a new beginning must be made. There are always new lessons to learn, new challenges to overcome, and cool new projects to get involved with.  So as of today, I\xE2\x80\x99m not longer employed by Sogeti, and will be moving on to a stealth-startup here in Houston.</p>\n\
      <p>Before you ask, no, this is not my startup, it\xE2\x80\x99s someone elses. I\xE2\x80\x99ll still be working on Just for Bands and a couple of other projects I have in the works (more on these soon, I hope). But this is a company that hired me to work with them on getting their product launched.  Since I have a little bit of experience in that area, here\xE2\x80\x99s hoping I can help them with theirs.</p>\n\
      <p>What will I be doing? At first it will mainly be Ruby on Rails work. But long term there is some mobile application development that will need to be done and I\xE2\x80\x99m hoping I can get my feet wet in that area too. I\xE2\x80\x99m the second developer on the ground, so there\xE2\x80\x99s some room for growth as well. It promises to be an interesting project where I will get to apply some of the things I have recently learned about Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and getting an app from idea to launch. Hopefully I can learn a few things along the way as well.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Google announced that they would be holding back with regards to releasing the latest version of the Android operating system. The release in question, Android 3.0 aka Honeycomb aka the version for tablets. The reasoning for this they say is two fold: 1) the code isn\xE2\x80\x99t ready to be released to the public, and 2) they don\xE2\x80\x99t want manufacturers attempting to put Honeycomb on smaller form factor devices (read \xE2\x80\x9Cmobile phones\xE2\x80\x9D).\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Then Google announced today that they were going to tighten the requirements on releasing Android based products. More specifically they were going to enforce the clause in their licensing agreement (the one that allows companies to use the \xE2\x80\x9Cwith Google\xE2\x80\x9D tag on their devices like the recently released Motorola Xoom) that the devices must meet certain standards and certain objectives must be met.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I want to look at both of these things in this article, because they kind of go hand in hand. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/04/01/google-android-and-open-source/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\

The reasoning for this they say is two fold: 1) the code isn\xE2\x80\x99t ready to be released to the public, and 2) they don\xE2\x80\x99t want manufacturers attempting to put Honeycomb on smaller form factor devices (read \xE2\x80\x9Cmobile phones\xE2\x80\x9D).</p>\n\
      <p>Then Google announced yesterday that they were going to tighten the requirements on releasing Android based products. More specifically they were going to enforce the clause in their licensing agreement (the one that allows companies to use the \xE2\x80\x9Cwith Google\xE2\x80\x9D tag on their devices like the recently released Motorola Xoom) that the devices must meet certain standards and certain objectives must be met.</p>\n\
      <p>I want to look at both of these things in this article, because they kind of go hand in hand.<span id=\"more-1621\"></span></p>\n\
      <h3>Open Sourcing Code</h3>\n\
      <p>If you are not familiar with the term \xE2\x80\x9Copen source\xE2\x80\x9D to simplify things (because trust me that term is a can of worms), it basically means that the source code, or rather the application code for a computer program is available to the public to download, modify, and even re-release, if they adhere to the license under which the code was released.</p>\n\
      <p>The base Android operating system is open sourced. If you want, you can follow the instructions and download the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) to your computer, modify the code, compile it, and (if brave enough) put it on your device. As newer versions of Android are released on devices, the source code is then placed into the AOSP source code repository.  What Google recently announced is that they would be holding back releasing Honeycomb source to the AOSP repository. Lets look at their reasons, and my thoughts on them as well.</p>\n\
      <p>But before going further I want to make one thing clear. Google never stated that they would never release the Honeycomb source code. Not once. They just said they weren\xE2\x80\x99t going to release it \xE2\x80\x9Crignt now\xE2\x80\x9D.  There\xE2\x80\x99s a huge difference.</p>\n\
      <h4>The Code Isn\xE2\x80\x99t Ready for Release</h4>\n\
      <p>If you\xE2\x80\x99ve followed the Android story, you know that recently Google hired one of the primary user interface (UI) designers from Palm. He was (obviously) tasked with bringing a nicer user experience to Android (something that many people have long complained about). Honeycomb is the first release of this new UI (you could say Android 2.3 was, but really that was nothing more than a new skin, Honeycomb\xE2\x80\x99s UI changes go deep).</p>\n\
      <p>When it comes to Honeycomb, the turnaround time on the new tablet version of Android was pretty quick (say around 9 months). And if anyone knows anything about writing code, they probably know that this means the code is hacked together is probably held together with little more than scotch tape. In other words, this isn\xE2\x80\x99t Google\xE2\x80\x99s finest work and so they\xE2\x80\x99re not really wanting to put it out on display to the public just yet.</p>\n\
      <p>Also, it was announced (before this announcment, oh how quickly the internet forgets), that much of the user interface changes in Honeycomb would be merged into \xE2\x80\x9CIce Cream\xE2\x80\x9D (the next version of the phone OS), and that Google plans to bring all of Android back under a single version again, eliminating the need for two different versions of the OS for different kinds of devices.  So when I read this announcement, this was my first thought.</p>\n\
      <p>\xE2\x80\x9COf course\xE2\x80\x9D I said to myself, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhy not wait to release the code when you\xE2\x80\x99re back to a single codebase.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\
      <p>It makes sense to first clean up the code, and then bring it back in line with the rest of the code so that you can return to a single code base when it\xE2\x80\x99s released.</p>\n\
      <h4>Non-Tablet Devices</h4>\n\
      <p>The first Android tablets to hit the market all ran Android 2.2 (ie Frozen Yogurt, aka Froyo). Google advised companies to not do this, stating that Froyo wasn\xE2\x80\x99t designed with tablets in mind. When they made that public statement they also announced that they were in fact working on a version for tablets, and pleaded with manufacturers to hold off on releasing Android based tablets.</p>\n\
      <p>Those manufacturers didn\xE2\x80\x99t listen.</p>\n\
      <p>So Google is learning from their mistakes. They know they\xE2\x80\x99re going to merge the 2 form factor code bases back into a single code base, they\xE2\x80\x99ve announced as such. They do not want manufacturers putting Honeycomb on phone size devices (the opposite of what was done with the tablets).</p>\n\
      <p>This goes back to Google probably wanting to wait until they\xE2\x80\x99re back onto a single code base for all device types before releasing the source code to AOSP.</p>\n\
      <h3>Google Tightens Their Grip</h3>\n\
      <p>When Android was first announced, they went to great lengths to push the open source angle. What this open sourcing of Android meant was that manufacturers had a base operating system to build off of. It gave them a fighting edge in the fight against the now (out of the blue) popular Apple iPhone. Really, the iPhone came out and caught every cell phone manufacturer off guard, they didn\xE2\x80\x99t have a plan to compete, Android helped. There was a base OS that they could build on, and many did.  Phone makers HTC, Samsung, and Motorola all released devices using Android with their own user interface.</p>\n\
      <p>These interfaces (some of them) improve on the user interface of Android.  The SenseUI from HTC being fairly popular. But they cause delays when it comes to getting newer versions of Android onto mobile phones because the manufacturers have to make deep modifcations to have the new version of Android work with their third party user interfaces. This in turn leads to what many people have begun calling \xE2\x80\x9Cfragmentation\xE2\x80\x9D and means that there are, at any given moment, a number of different Android versions on phones in the market.</p>\n\
      <p>Google also has some language in their license for Android that sets certain requirements for the devices if they want to use the \xE2\x80\x9Cwith Google\xE2\x80\x9D branding and install the Google applications suite (Gmail, Android Market, etc). What Google has actually announced is that they will be more strictly enforcing this clause. The end goal, limiting fragmentation. Limiting the number of different versions of Android in the wild at any given moment.</p>\n\
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\
      <p>I don\xE2\x80\x99t view either one of these decisions as Google going back on the \xE2\x80\x9CAndroid is open source\xE2\x80\x9D mantra. One is just ensuring their best work is in the public repository, and the other is taking just a little more control over the operating system which really just means good things down the road with regards to OS updates and other things related to Android specifically. To me the idea is to bring things more in line to a single way of doing things rather than having a bunch of divergent paths for the Android operating system. The end result being less fragmentation, a single code base, and an overall better experience on Android.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Is that feature/idea absolutely essential to booking a show for your band?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      If the answer to that question was a \"No\" then we shelved the idea for possible later inclusion.  It might seem like a really weird idea to not build as many features as possible, but doing so keeps you on the path to actually launching your product.  If we hadn't followed that one simple rule when deciding where to focus our work, Erick and I would still be working on LiveShow and wouldn't have gotten it out the door.  If you don't ever release your product/application then you can never make money off of it. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/02/01/build-only-whats-necessary/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Erick and I set out to build <a title=\"LiveShow - Simple Booking Management to Help You Amplify Your Career\" href=\"http://www.booktheliveshow.com\">LiveShow</a>, we wrote down literally every idea that came to mind.  No matter how outrageous, complex, forward thinking, backwards thinking, or idiotic, if it was an idea related to booking shows we wrote it down.  When it came time to actually build the application, it became my job to keep us on the straight and narrow.  Because as we worked on the application, more ideas came to mind.</p>\n\
      <h3>Is it Absolutely Necessary</h3>\n\
      <p>Eventually it all came down to one simple question: Is that feature/idea absolutely essential to booking a show for your band?</p>\n\
      <p>If the answer to that question was a &#8220;No&#8221; then we shelved the idea for possible later inclusion. \xC2\xA0It might seem like a really weird idea to not build as many features as possible, but doing so keeps you on the path to actually launching your product. \xC2\xA0If we hadn&#8217;t followed that one simple rule when deciding where to focus our work, Erick and I would still be working on LiveShow and wouldn&#8217;t have gotten it out the door. \xC2\xA0If you don&#8217;t ever release your product/application then you can never make money off of it.</p>\n\
      <h3>Release Early, Release Often</h3>\n\
      <p>Creating an an application that runs and works on the internet means that you can release a product early and gradually add to its feature set as time passes. \xC2\xA0The phrase is often heard in what is known as the &#8220;agile development method&#8221; and it&#8217;s called &#8220;Release early, release often&#8221; and it means to release the product at the earliest possible point and then gradually improve it over time (have many successive releases).</p>\n\
      <p>If you want an example of a company that does this frequently, look no further than Google. \xC2\xA0A good example of Google doing this would be Gmail, their online email product. \xC2\xA0When Gmail was first released it allowed you to do 2 things with the emails you got: read them or archive them. \xC2\xA0There was no &#8220;delete&#8221; button because Gmail gave users one gigabyte of space, compared to Yahoo and Hotmail which gave around 250 megabytes of storage, that was a lot of space. \xC2\xA0They believed you&#8217;d never need to delete an email again. \xC2\xA0Over time they found that customers really wanted to be able to delete so they added a delete button, and then they add a &#8220;Trash&#8221; folder so you could recover accidentally deleted emails. \xC2\xA0They also over time added Google Talk to Gmail. \xC2\xA0And more recently they added the ability to make phone calls from within Gmail. \xC2\xA0Gmail is just one example of Google doing this. \xC2\xA0Android is another example, so is Google Calendar.</p>\n\
      <p>The idea is to get your product out in front of the public. \xC2\xA0Even if it doesn&#8217;t have all the features you&#8217;d want it to have, if it at least accomplishes the basic goal of the application then it&#8217;s good enough to launch with. \xC2\xA0Just because you launch it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s done. \xC2\xA0You can still make changes, add features, and fix bugs. \xC2\xA0Getting the product out in front of people allows you to figure out how people will use your application. \xC2\xA0You might find that they use it in a way that you hadn&#8217;t foreseen and that might give you a whole new direction to go in (read about Flickr&#8217;s early beginnings for a good example of this).</p>\n\
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\
      <p>When you start to build something, ask yourself what is the absolute essential things your product needs to allow users to achieve their goals. \xC2\xA0If a feature or idea isn&#8217;t a part of that, then shelve it for later. \xC2\xA0You want to get the product out to the public so they can use it, not keep it to yourself until it&#8217;s &#8220;perfect&#8221; because realistically it will never be perfect. \xC2\xA0Get it out there.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Do you say something like \"Man it would be great is someone would create a site that does [fill in the blank]\" a lot?  Do you find yourself coming up with great ideas only to forget them a couple of hours later?  Have you ever told an idea to your friends, have them tell you it's horrible, only to see the exact product a year later released by someone else?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Well, do something about it. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/01/31/thinking-of-starting-a-web-business-you-can-do-it/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you say something like &#8220;Man it would be great is someone would create a site that does [fill in the blank]&#8221; a lot? \xC2\xA0Do you find yourself coming up with great ideas only to forget them a couple of hours later? \xC2\xA0Have you ever told an idea to your friends, have them tell you it&#8217;s horrible, only to see the exact product a year later released by someone else?</p>\n\
      <p>Well, do something about it.</p>\n\
      <h3>Write Your Ideas Down</h3>\n\
      <p>Have a great idea? \xC2\xA0Write it down. \xC2\xA0In a notebook, in <a title=\"Evernote\" href=\"http://www.evernote.com\">Evernote</a> (or <a title=\"SpringPad\" href=\"http://springpadit.com/\">SpringPad</a>), on a napkin that you put in your pocket, write the idea down. \xC2\xA0Basically store it somewhere that you won&#8217;t lose it later. \xC2\xA0If you write the idea down, you can come back to it later. \xC2\xA0I can&#8217;t tell you the number of ideas I let slip away because I had this great idea while I was at work and didn&#8217;t write it down. \xC2\xA0So I started carrying a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8883701143?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=almosnotyet-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=8883701143\">notebook</a> (Amazon affiliate link) around. \xC2\xA0When I have an idea, I stop and write it in my notebook on one of the pages dedicated to business ideas. \xC2\xA0This allows me to easily find it later. \xC2\xA0If I don&#8217;t have the notebook with me for some reason, I open up Evernote (web page or application) and write it down in a note that is specific to my business ideas. \xC2\xA0Sure it means I have to look in two places when I&#8217;m reviewing those ideas, but at least I don&#8217;t forget the idea.</p>\n\
      <p>Don&#8217;t just write down the idea. \xC2\xA0Write down anything related to it. \xC2\xA0For example, I once had an idea to give companies the ability to create their own secure chat server, so I wrote the idea down, but I also wrote down to look at cloud computing options that would allow me to start and stop servers as needed, chat server software, protocols, and so on. \xC2\xA0That way I just didn&#8217;t write down the idea but also the surrounding ideas so I knew what direction I wanted to go.</p>\n\
      <h3>Pick An Idea</h3>\n\
      <p>After you&#8217;ve gotten a few ideas written down, spend a Saturday reviewing them. \xC2\xA0Flesh them out a little. \xC2\xA0What do you need to implement those ideas? \xC2\xA0What things should you research more? \xC2\xA0Which one really gets you fired up? \xC2\xA0If you find that an idea sparks a million other thoughts about that idea, go with it. \xC2\xA0If you aren&#8217;t passionate about it, you&#8217;re probably not going to get very far with it. \xC2\xA0However, if you find that a specific idea really gets your brain going, focus on it. \xC2\xA0It&#8217;s really about passion. \xC2\xA0You&#8217;re going to have to really like that idea to be able to spend the next year or so working on it.</p>\n\
      <h3>Keep it Simple</h3>\n\
      <p>That idea that&#8217;s spawning a million thoughts a second, that&#8217;s good. \xC2\xA0But don&#8217;t let yourself get carried away with all those secondary ideas. \xC2\xA0Write them down so you don&#8217;t lose them to the ether. \xC2\xA0Instead, after you&#8217;ve written them down go ahead and pick the absolute essentials. \xC2\xA0For every sub-idea, ask &#8220;is this absolutely essential to accomplishing the initial idea&#8221; and if the answer is &#8220;no&#8221; then move onto the next sub-idea. \xC2\xA0This will help you determine what&#8217;s really important to the idea. \xC2\xA0The ideas that aren&#8217;t absolutely essential can be worked on/implemented after launch.</p>\n\
      <p><strong>This is important</strong>: If it&#8217;s not absolutely essential to the achieve the goal of your product, you don&#8217;t need it to launch.</p>\n\
      <h3>Build It</h3>\n\
      <p>This is one of the most important thing to do. \xC2\xA0Build it. \xC2\xA0Get working on it as soon as you can. \xC2\xA0You&#8217;ll hit road blocks, have burn out, and have to put some time in during your off hours. \xC2\xA0But if you don&#8217;t build it, you can&#8217;t release it. \xC2\xA0Set up a schedule to work on the project. \xC2\xA0A couple of hours a day, no less than three days a week. \xC2\xA0Having such a schedule really helps you to set aside time for the project but still allow you to have a life. \xC2\xA0Having a life outside of work and your side project will delay any burn out experience you&#8217;re likely to have.</p>\n\
      <p>When you do hit a period of burn out, work on something else related to the project. \xC2\xA0Don&#8217;t have the website design, work on that. \xC2\xA0Formulate plans for after the launch of the product. \xC2\xA0Organize the to-do list or write a blog post about what you&#8217;re working on or some of the lessons learned so far. \xC2\xA0These things help you get through the burn outs but allow you to maintain momentum and your work schedule.</p>\n\
      <h3>Release It</h3>\n\
      <p>This is probably the most important part of the whole process. \xC2\xA0Getting it out to the public. \xC2\xA0Letting real users hack away and break things. \xC2\xA0Hey, thinks are going to break, accept this truth early on and you will be less stressed about it. \xC2\xA0But releasing your product means you completed the process. \xC2\xA0You took an idea from inception all the way to release. \xC2\xA0Sure you probably hit some snags along the way. \xC2\xA0It probably took you a little longer than you initially thought (it always does). \xC2\xA0But, it&#8217;s released, it&#8217;s out there.</p>\n\
      <p>Unfortunately, just releasing the product isn&#8217;t enough. \xC2\xA0You&#8217;ll need to make enhancements. \xC2\xA0Those ideas I said you need to put to the side because they&#8217;re not essential, start cherry picking those and working on them. \xC2\xA0You&#8217;ll have bugs to fix. \xC2\xA0There will be customers to support, they&#8217;re going to request things. \xC2\xA0Getting here though is the just the start of the journey. \xC2\xA0If you can get to this point, you&#8217;ve made it farther than most.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>If you use the Vim editor (or one of it&amp;#8217;s counterparts like gVim), use the RubyTest Vim Plugin, and you use RSpec for some of your testing then you might run into a problem that I was experiencing where it &amp;#8230; &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/01/29/vim-rubytest-and-rspec/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\

      </pre>\n\
      <p>Well, since I use RSpec 2.x (since I&#8217;m just now starting to use RSpec), the above error is quite annoying because the &#8216;spec&#8217; command isn&#8217;t really used anymore (at least from what I can find on the internet). \xC2\xA0So to get the RubyTest plugin to work with RSpec (and the &#8216;rspec&#8217; command) you have to make a small change the plugin as marked below via a diff.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Over the course of 2010 I spent most of my off time working on my side project, Just for Bands.  Specifically the first application to come from Just for Bands known as LiveShow.  The LiveShow application was written in Ruby on Rails with the plan to deploy it to Heroku (a successful plan I might add).  But the main point of this post is the idea of doing Test Driven Development (or TDD) in Ruby on Rails and how it allowed my partner and I to build an app quickly. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/01/28/testing-in-rails-its-important/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of 2010 I spent most of my off time working on my side project, <a title=\"Just for Bands\" href=\"http://www.justforbands.com\">Just for Bands</a>. \xC2\xA0Specifically the first application to come from Just for Bands known as LiveShow. \xC2\xA0The <a title=\"LiveShow - Simple Booking Management to Help Amplify Your Career\" href=\"http://www.booktheliveshow.com\">LiveShow</a> application was written in Ruby on Rails with the plan to deploy it to Heroku (a successful plan I might add). \xC2\xA0But the main point of this post is the idea of doing Test Driven Development (or TDD) in <a title=\"Ruby on Rails\" href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org\">Ruby on Rails</a> and how it allowed my partner and I to build an app quickly.</p>\n\
      <h3>Testing is Built In</h3>\n\
      <p>Something to know about testing frameworks and Ruby on Rails, there&#8217;s one built in. \xC2\xA0The built in testing framework in Ruby on Rails is Test::Unit. \xC2\xA0There are other frameworks that you can substitute in place of Test::Unit, but as far as &#8220;out of the box&#8221; frameworks go, you could do worse. \xC2\xA0Having a framework built in allowed me to teach Erick (my partner, who had never worked in Rails before) how to follow the TDD workflow: Write test, run test (seeing it fail), write minimal code to make test pass, see test pass, <strong>refactor</strong> (bold because people tend to forget this step). \xC2\xA0Erick had never done test driven development before, and I had never used Test::Unit (or written a Ruby on Rails app) before, so sticking with the built in framework allowed us to minimize the number of things we needed to learn from the get go.</p>\n\
      <h3>Delegation of Responsibilities</h3>\n\
      <p>Erick and I had a pretty strict division of responsibilities with regards to the work needed on the application. \xC2\xA0Since I&#8217;ve been developing code professionally for almost a decade, I was the developer. \xC2\xA0Erick was the sweeper, going between design and development duties where ever needed. \xC2\xA0And we hired a graphic designer, John to handle the more complex design work. \xC2\xA0Having such divisions allowed us to separate out the work. \xC2\xA0But it left me in a position where I felt I couldn&#8217;t develop a ton of code because I didn&#8217;t have any screens to wire up. \xC2\xA0This came from a lack of deep understanding of the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern that Rails is based on. \xC2\xA0To keep it quick, this pattern means there&#8217;s separation between the UI, data, and processing layers.</p>\n\
      <h3>Testing Allows Coding Without The User Interface</h3>\n\
      <p>Because the MVC pattern is designed with separation of various application elements in mind, I was able to develop the backend code without any screens. \xC2\xA0The idea of testing functionality as you develop using the built in test framework allowed most of the major functionality to be written and built while the design was worked out else where. \xC2\xA0This was crucial to our ability to get the product built and launched in one year&#8217;s time, while learning new languages and tools. \xC2\xA0Once the functionality was done, it was just a matter of tying it together with the user interface once we had a design we were happy with. \xC2\xA0Of course there were things that didn&#8217;t work quite like expected when we got the interface wired up, but it was less work than doing it from scratch, and having to wait would have meant delaying the product.</p>\n\
      <p>Also, with the tests we were able to see if it was the UI not working correctly or if it was really our functionality. \xC2\xA0In a couple of places we were testing for the wrong thing, or had an error in our test that caused a false positive. \xC2\xA0But those were much quicker to iron out with the tests in place. \xC2\xA0Having unit tested as we developed, we were able to save tons of time on the backend of the project fixing bugs.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>With the launch of LiveShow by Just for Bands last week, the stress of getting something done and pushed for public consumption is only half done.  Having actually \"shipped\" a working product, I understand that it is the larger (and harder) half. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/01/10/ship-it/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://www.booktheliveshow.com\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1600\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" title=\"LiveShow\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ad-liveshow.jpg\" alt=\"LiveShow\" width=\"205\" height=\"125\" /></a>With the launch of <a title=\"LiveShow - Just for Bands\" href=\"http://www.booktheliveshow.com\">LiveShow</a> by <a title=\"Just for Bands\" href=\"http://www.justforbands.com\">Just for Bands</a> last week, the stress of getting something done and pushed for public consumption is only half done. \xC2\xA0Having actually &#8220;shipped&#8221; a working product, I understand that it is the larger (and harder) half.</p>\n\
      <p>LiveShow took about 2 hours a night 4-5 nights a week for an entire year to get ready. \xC2\xA0The idea was always to get a basic product that did just what was needed to accomplish the goal done and pushed out for people to use. \xC2\xA0Yes, we occasionally got burned out. \xC2\xA0Yes, some things didn&#8217;t go quite as planned. \xC2\xA0Yes, we got behind sometimes. \xC2\xA0But we met our goal and launched within a year&#8217;s timeframe. \xC2\xA0What was the secret? \xC2\xA0We didn&#8217;t stop. \xC2\xA0If we got burned out we worked on other aspects, brainstormed, and generally found busy work that needed to be done.</p>\n\
      <p>But the real secret comes from the time boxing. \xC2\xA0Saying to ourselves nightly &#8220;I have 2 hours, I want to have [Feature X] working by then&#8221; and then working towards that. \xC2\xA0The feature being worked on could have just been one piece of a larger feature. \xC2\xA0But time boxing allowed us to really focus on what we were working on. \xC2\xA0When you have a seriously limited amount of time, it helps decide what needs to be worked on. \xC2\xA0On several occasions I scrapped my work and started fresh the next night because something took me longer than 2 hours during the first go. \xC2\xA0Most of the time, I was doing it wrong to begin with, but I had to do it wrong to find the right way and those couple of hours that might have seemed like a waste were actual pivotal in finding a solution that worked (and in many places more elegant).</p>\n\
      <p>Time boxing also allowed us to maintain family and social obligations. \xC2\xA0We started this project with our own time, our own money, and had to learn a few things on the way. \xC2\xA0We didn&#8217;t quit our day jobs and we certainly couldn&#8217;t deprive our families of our time. \xC2\xA0Time boxing allowed us to maintain a normal life. \xC2\xA0Sure we worked a little more than usual after hours, but the focus that time boxing allows and the fact that we limited our time allowed us to not get carried away.</p>\n\
      <p>If you&#8217;re looking to do your own side project, I recommend time boxing yourself to a couple of hours a night 3-5 nights a week. \xC2\xA0This will allow you to be moving constantly towards your goal without taking over your life. \xC2\xA0It certainly worked for Erick and I when working on LiveShow, and it&#8217;s one of the tent pole points of <a title=\"Getting Real from 37Signals\" href=\"http://gettingreal.37signals.com/\">37Signals&#8217; book &#8220;Getting Real&#8221;</a>. \xC2\xA0Give it shot, you have nothing to lose.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Yep,  today my partner Erick and I announced that LiveShow, the first Just for Bands app was ready for the world's viewing.  It took a year's worth of programming time at home after work and on weekends, learning a new programming language, learning a new web framework for writing web applications, designing a data model, and figuring out where the app should live.  But, it's officially shipped as of today around 1:30pm. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2011/01/03/liveshow-ships/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\

      <p>What is LiveShow? \xC2\xA0Simply, it&#8217;s a communication manager for bands that lets them track what band members are talking to what venues with regards to booking live shows (concerts, gigs, etc). \xC2\xA0The idea was simplicity. \xC2\xA0Get people in and out quickly so they can move on to other tasks. \xC2\xA0No one wants to sit and organize communications, add things to a calendar, set reminders, and so on. \xC2\xA0LiveShow does it automatically. \xC2\xA0As the user logs a communication with a potential venue, LiveShow will automatically set a reminder and the user will be emailed about the follow up when it&#8217;s time.</p>\n\
      <p>This was my first time doing a project from the ground up and as the main technical person who was in charge of backend design, coding practices, and development tools used so I&#8217;ll be spending some time over the next few blog posts going talking about some of the decisions we made from a technical standpoint, so keep an eye out for those if you&#8217;re interested. \xC2\xA0With this post, I officially enter the &#8220;start up&#8221; world, and become an entrepreneur. \xC2\xA0Hopefully good times are ahead.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>If you're ever had the privilege of reading \"Pragmatic Programmers\" then you know that they recommend that programmers learn at least one new language a year.   Around this time last year, I made the decision to begin following that practice and chose Ruby/Ruby on Rails as my programming language for 2010.  While not directly related to my day job, I wanted to build something in the language.  With the help of my friend we were able to build Just for Bands in Ruby on Rails, both learning the language as we went along. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/10/04/learning-a-programming-language-a-year-a-plan/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1586\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"The Pragmatic Programmer\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/PragProg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"265\" height=\"333\" />If you&#8217;re ever had the\xC2\xA0privilege\xC2\xA0of reading &#8220;The Pragmatic Programmer&#8221; then you know that they recommend that programmers learn at least one new language a year. \xC2\xA0 Around this time last year, I made the decision to begin following that practice and chose Ruby/Ruby on Rails as my programming language for 2010. \xC2\xA0While not directly related to my day job, I wanted to build something in the language. \xC2\xA0With the help of my friend we were able to build our first\xC2\xA0<a title=\"Just for Bands\" href=\"http://www.justforbands.com\">Just for Bands</a> web application\xC2\xA0in Ruby on Rails (<a title=\"Just for Bands: LiveShow\" href=\"http://www.booktheliveshow.com\">LiveShow</a>), both learning the language as we went along. \xC2\xA0While I&#8217;m still by no means a Ruby/Rails expert, I do feel some what comfortable enough with the framework. \xC2\xA0I still have to look up how to do things in Ruby, but this is just the side effect of learning a language. \xC2\xA0You&#8217;ll almost never know everything about a language.</p>\n\
      <h3>Observation</h3>\n\
      <p>I believe that part of the problem is that I&#8217;m not surrounded by other Ruby/Rails programmers and doing that kind of work on day to day basis. \xC2\xA0I spent 5 years in a C# office and thus was able to learn C# pretty well, and when I left that shop to better pursue programming, I was surround by &#8220;better&#8221; C# programmers that taught me even more. \xC2\xA0I believe that I would be better at Ruby today (not having to look as many things up) if I was in an environment that was utilizing the language (and/or Rails framework) on a daily basis.</p>\n\
      <h3>The Plan</h3>\n\
      <p>I plan to continue in my attempt to learn a new language every year. \xC2\xA0Upon\xC2\xA0further\xC2\xA0reading of several blog posts, I came across one that suggested that not only learning a new language but to also rotate the paradigms behind the language you learn (object oriented, dynamic, functional, etc). \xC2\xA0This not only allows you to learn a new language but also new concepts and new ways of thinking about problems because a functional language requires a very different thought process than dynamic one.</p>\n\
      <p>So with that in mind, here&#8217;s what my language plan looks like over the next few years:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n\
      <li>Oct &#8211; Dec 2010: Ruby</li>\n\
      <li>2011: Clojure</li>\n\
      <li>2012: C</li>\n\
      </ul>\n\
      <p>I went with <a title=\"Clojure\" href=\"http://clojure.org/\">Clojure</a> for a couple of reasons. \xC2\xA0The first being that it&#8217;s a functional language. \xC2\xA0Secondly, it&#8217;s not tied to the Microsoft .NET platform (like F#). \xC2\xA0While I&#8217;ve heard and seen good things about F#, I wanted to keep the Microsoft stack strictly a day-job thing. \xC2\xA0Plus Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine, so it can really run on any machine that runs Java. \xC2\xA0Finally, going with Clojure will bring some experience with <a title=\"Lisp Programming Language\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)\">Lisp</a>, since Clojure is very Lisp like. \xC2\xA0This will bring me at least a smidging of experience with using Lisp, without actually having to learn Lisp.</p>\n\
      <p>As for C, some would argue that the C programming language is a &#8220;functional&#8221; language. \xC2\xA0And while there is truth in that point of view, I personally view C as &#8220;systems language&#8221; (something used to write drivers, operating systems, etc). \xC2\xA0Learning C is also a personal mission of mine, and one that I&#8217;ve had since \xC2\xA0was 15 and never just banged it out. \xC2\xA0Something else always came up.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>What is Just for Bands?  Just for Bands is a side project I started with a very close friend of mine, Erick Wilson.  The idea came about because Erick wanted to find a set of online tools to help him and his band handle certain band management related activities.  I told him, that we should instead write our own since we know what bands go through and what kind of stuff we can eliminate to make the process efficient and streamlined. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/09/26/just-for-bands-launches/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\

      <p>Today is an exciting day for me. \xC2\xA0Something I&#8217;ve spent the last 10 months working on has started it reveal its public face. \xC2\xA0My side project, <a title=\"Just for Bands\" href=\"http://justforbands.com/\">Just for Bands</a>, has officially launched.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Yep, I broke down and finally bought a Kindle.  The latest generation of the Kindle just finally sold me on getting one.  The price was right, and the recent changes to the overall design were nice too.  Why did I get a Kindle over the \"magical\" Apple iPad?  One reason, I wanted a device specifically for reading.  Sure you can read books on the iPad, but it's a brightly lit LCD screen, plus the iPad is a little weighty.  The iPad is a nice device for what it is, but for something to read long term on, it really isn't up to snuff.  I wanted to read books and I wanted it to have a true page like feel to what I was looking at. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/09/25/got-a-kindle/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://www.kindle.com\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1573\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Amazon Kindle\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/kindle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"270\" height=\"378\" /></a>Yep, I broke down and finally bought a Kindle. \xC2\xA0The latest generation of the Kindle just finally sold me on getting one. \xC2\xA0The price was right, and the recent changes to the overall design were nice too. \xC2\xA0Why did I get a Kindle over the &#8220;magical&#8221; Apple iPad? \xC2\xA0One reason, I wanted a device specifically for reading. \xC2\xA0Sure you can read books on the iPad, but it&#8217;s a brightly lit LCD screen, plus the iPad is a little weighty. \xC2\xA0The iPad is a nice device for what it is, but for something to read long term on, it really isn&#8217;t up to snuff. \xC2\xA0I wanted to read books and I wanted it to have a true page like feel to what I was looking at.</p>\n\
      <h3>Initial Impressions</h3>\n\
      <p>When I first took the Kindle out of its box and turned it on, I was immediately impressed with how the screen looks. \xC2\xA0Instantly I could tell that the eInk screen was going to serve the purpose it was meant to serve with little trouble. \xC2\xA0It really felt like reading off of a page with ink on it rather than reading a digital screen. \xC2\xA0The contrast on the latest Kindle devices is very nice as well. \xC2\xA0When I first put the Kindle into standby and saw one of the screen saver images that came on the screen, I was instantly impressed with the image quality. \xC2\xA0Sure, it was in black and white, but it was a very nicely defined black and white.</p>\n\
      <p>Since I had previously used the Kindle app on my iPhone and my current Android device, I already had some Kindle books purchased and waiting to be downloaded. \xC2\xA0Navigating to my archived books and downloading them was simple enough, even if the refresh rate on the eInk screen doesn&#8217;t make for a wonky navigation experience. \xC2\xA0It&#8217;s almost like it redraws the screen everytime you do something (this is probably actually what it&#8217;s doing, I&#8217;d have to read more on eInk to be sure). \xC2\xA0However, the wonkiness doesn&#8217;t completely detract from the overall user experience for basic reading and usage of the device. \xC2\xA0Where it&#8217;s really\xC2\xA0noticeable\xC2\xA0that this screen was not mean to do much more than show something closely resembling a printed page is when you try to use the Kindle&#8217;s built in web browser. \xC2\xA0That&#8217;s when the user experience can go way wrong. \xC2\xA0This device was meant to read books, not surf the net.</p>\n\
      <h3>Reading Books</h3>\n\
      <p>You buy a Kindle to read books on. \xC2\xA0That&#8217;s it. \xC2\xA0It&#8217;s not an all in one device like the iPad. \xC2\xA0So getting Kindle means you kind of hope that it will work for reading books quite well. \xC2\xA0I&#8217;m happy to say that just from this past week of using the Kindle it definitely handles the task of being easy to read off of. \xC2\xA0I&#8217;m officially convinced that the Kindle will do for books what the iPod did for music and it will become\xC2\xA0synonymous\xC2\xA0with electronic books the same way the iPod became synonymous with digital music. \xC2\xA0It just does the job so well. \xC2\xA0I&#8217;ve played with the Nook and the Sony eReaders and the experience with the Kindle just feels better overall. \xC2\xA0While the Sony eReaders are nice, my initial experience with the Kindle in the same time span as with the Sony eReaders was just a better, more pleasant experience. \xC2\xA0This might partially be due to the Kindle&#8217;s WhisperSync that allowed me to get books onto the device without having to plug into a computer.</p>\n\
      <h3>Conclusions</h3>\n\
      <p>I have to say that the Kindle presents me with the nice opportunity to carry around some books to read, without having to carry the physical books. \xC2\xA0This means a lighter bag to carry and less bulk when actually reading. \xC2\xA0The Kindle is a joy to hold in my hand and reading off the screen is nice. \xC2\xA0Overall, I was impressed and ultimately satisfied with my purchase.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>While having a discussion with a friend of mine earlier today about how I would tell if programming candidate was up to snuff, I realized that a lot of programmers out there are probably missing a lot of chances to get better jobs, find more work (if they're a contractor), or just a simple learning opportunity by not having their source code for their personal programming projects stored in an online code repository.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/09/21/get-your-source-code-online/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While having a discussion with a friend of mine earlier today about how I would tell if programming candidate was up to snuff, I realized that a lot of programmers out there are probably missing a lot of chances to get better jobs, find more work (if they&#8217;re a contractor), or just a simple learning opportunity by not having their source code for their personal programming projects stored in an online code repository. \xC2\xA0With online code repositories like <a title=\"GitHub\" href=\"http://www.github.com\">GitHub</a>, <a title=\"Google Code\" href=\"http://code.google.com\">Google Code</a>, or <a title=\"CodePlex\" href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/\">CodePlex</a>, there is no excuse for a developer to not have the source code to their personal projects stored online. \xC2\xA0GitHub even gives you the option to pay for an account that will allow you store some projects online privately.</p>\n\
      <p>A good developer already knows that using source control is a good practice that every developer should be following regularly. \xC2\xA0So using a online source control repository, means that not only are you doing source control but you also have an offline copy of all your code. \xC2\xA0If you computer was to ever crash, then getting back to where you left off isn&#8217;t nearly as difficult than having to start from scratch.</p>\n\
      <p>But one important aspect that doing this buys you, is when you&#8217;re talking to potential employer (or client), and they ask for code samples (as any good interviewer, interviewing people for a programming position should do) you&#8217;ll be able to point them at your repositories to allow them to peruse through and see what kind of work you can do. \xC2\xA0Seeing someone&#8217;s code can really help a good developer interviewer see how a potential employee thinks out problems and organizes solutions to those problems. \xC2\xA0This can be an important first step towards determining if the interviewee has some skill.</p>\n\
      <p>The downside is that a nice looking code repository can be faked. \xC2\xA0A good interviewer will know what questions to ask and what answers to look for when asking about the solutions presented in your code repositories. \xC2\xA0If they still have doubts, they could ask you (the interviewee) to take a coding test, but hey if you&#8217;re as good as you&#8217;re presenting to the interviewers then that should be cake, right?</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Google released Instant Search earlier this week.  It's a pretty spiffy piece of technology, if you're logged into your Google account and go to the Google search page, and start typing in a search, the screen will shift to show you results in an almost real time manner. Over the last few days, you hear a lot of tech pundits talking about how Google wasted it's time, because no one uses the Google search page anymore, they use the search bar in their browser.  So Google has spent time on a problem that doesn't really exist.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I disagree.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/09/12/google-instant-search/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google released Instant Search earlier this week.  It&#8217;s a pretty spiffy piece of technology, if you&#8217;re logged into your Google account and go to the Google search page, and start typing in a search, the screen will shift to show you results in an almost real time manner. Over the last few days, you hear a lot of tech pundits talking about how Google wasted it&#8217;s time, because no one uses the Google search page anymore, they use the search bar in their browser.  So Google has spent time on a problem that doesn&#8217;t really exist.</p>\n\
      <p>I disagree.  What I saw in Google&#8217;s new Instant Search is innovation in the search game.  While Bing (the only real competitor to Google since it also power&#8217;s Yahoo&#8217;s search engine) is still trying to catch up on cracking Google&#8217;s previous search algorithm and accuracy, Google brought out the next generation of search.  In other words, Google pretty much owns the search market, but they didn&#8217;t rest on their laurels (Internet Explorer anyone?).  Instead Google worked to create something that will now be an expectation of all things search within the next year or so.</p>\n\
      <p>The amount of infrastructure, architecture, database design, database programming, and so forth used to create Google Instant Search is a tremendous amount of smarts.  This is innovation is a computer science way rather than innovation in &#8220;lets solve a customer problem way&#8221; and while some would argue its the wrong focus, I&#8217;d argue that there is a place for both kinds of innovation in the tech world.  Things like the backend for Instant Search are important moves forward in solving the data problems of tomorrow.  We&#8217;re all sitting on large amounts of data, Facebook, Google, Twitter.  There are endless amounts of data there, and sense needs to be made of that data.</p>\n\
      <p>So before we start saying that Google isn&#8217;t solving a real problem, we need to think a little deeper than just a customer facing level.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>Over the 3 day weekend I decided I was going to write a simple Android application to publish to the Android App Market to find out a few things.  First, I wanted to see if I could do it, write an app with some kind of simple functionality quickly.  Secondly, I wanted to see what the process for publishing to the Android App Market was like.  We hear all the time about how Apple disapproves apps, and kicks apps out of the market (sometimes almost, it would seem, randomly). &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/09/07/rotation-cipher-my-first-android-app/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the 3 day weekend I decided I was going to write a simple Android application to publish to the Android App Market to find out a few things. \xC2\xA0First, I wanted to see if I could do it, write an app with some kind of simple functionality quickly. \xC2\xA0Secondly, I wanted to see what the process for publishing to the Android App Market was like. \xC2\xA0We hear all the time about how Apple disapproves apps, and kicks apps out of the market (sometimes almost, it would seem, randomly).</p>\n\
      <p>I&#8217;m happy to say that I was successful. \xC2\xA0I wrote a simple rotation cipher application (rotation cipher is also commonly known as the\xC2\xA0Caesar\xC2\xA0Cipher). \xC2\xA0It took me a grand total of maybe 4 hours to write the code (most of it spent on getting the UI just right), and then literally 15 minutes to publish it to the App Market. \xC2\xA0The moment I hit the &#8220;Publish&#8221; button, I was able to open the Android App Market on my phone, do a search, and find my app. \xC2\xA0Now that&#8217;s quick.</p>\n\
      <p>If you want to download and mess with my app, but I promise is not really something to write home about, you can use the QR code below, or goto the <a title=\"Rotation Cipher on AppBrain\" href=\"http://www.appbrain.com/app/koby.rotationcipher\">AppBrain page</a> directly.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>My question is, why would you ignore an obvious, growing sector of the mobile market?  Yes, I understand that right now, Apple has the store that has on numerous occasions made people millions for simple applications.  However, that doesn't mean that the Android Marketplace or Windows Phone 7 Marketplace will not make you any money. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/06/22/why-ignore-some-mobile-platforms/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I say <a title=\"App Advice - Angry Birds\xE2\x80\x99 Publisher Refusing Offers From Microsoft, Google\" href=\"http://appadvice.com/appnn/2010/06/angry-birds-developer-refusing-offers-microsoft-google/\">this article</a>, about the publisher of the popular iPhone game &#8220;Angry Birds&#8221; refusing offers from Microsoft and Google to write games for Windows Phone 7 and Android mobile operating systems. \xC2\xA0I&#8217;ve seen other people tweet similar things, usually saying things along the lines of &#8220;we won&#8217;t be writing Android apps any time soon&#8221; and similar quips.</p>\n\
      <p>My question is, why would you ignore an obvious, growing sector of the mobile market? \xC2\xA0Yes, I understand that right now, Apple has the store that has on numerous occasions made people millions for simple applications. \xC2\xA0However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that the Android Marketplace or Windows Phone 7 Marketplace will not make you any money.</p>\n\
      <p>We have developers who are making it a public point to not write applications for non-iPhone devices. \xC2\xA0Which to mean, from a business standpoint is a poor decision. \xC2\xA0I have no problems with writing the iPhone app first and getting it to market. \xC2\xA0People think iPhone when they think mobile app, so I get that you have to have an iPhone app to have mobile exposure. \xC2\xA0I understand this, I really do. \xC2\xA0But to say, well I see this other mobile OS (Android) is gaining market share, but I&#8217;m going to ignore it and only focus on the iPhone.</p>\n\
      <p>The only time that people seem to look at mobile application alternatives is when their app gets dumped from the iPhone App Store. \xC2\xA0You see it all the time, &#8220;Our app was removed for no reason&#8221; and while Steve Jobs has recently made it a point to say why most apps are removed, rejected from the store, we all know there are apps that shouldn&#8217;t have been rejected (Google Voice App anyone?). \xC2\xA0But again, this is the only time that people start looking at alternative avenues for mobile development. \xC2\xA0Wouldn&#8217;t a smart business plan be to have your app on as many platforms as possible? \xC2\xA0I know that I&#8217;d want to maximize my revenue streams, but some people seem to be okay with ignoring anything that isn&#8217;t the iPhone.</p>\n\
      <p>What are your thoughts on this? \xC2\xA0I&#8217;d really like to hear why some are choosing to ignore Android and Windows Phone 7 for their apps. \xC2\xA0Because to me it just seems like poor business. \xC2\xA0But hey, I could be wrong.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>It had to happen eventually.

      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://www.seesmic.com\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1557\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Seesmic\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/seesmic-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"202\" height=\"201\" /></a>It had to happen eventually. <a title=\"Twitter for iPhone (iTunes link)\" href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8\"> Twitter for iPhone</a> (previously known as Tweetie 2) is one of the best Twitter apps for the iPhone. \xC2\xA0It&#8217;s jammed packed with features but with some really nice UI elements that don&#8217;t give you that feeling of overload. \xC2\xA0But a couple of weeks back I switched to using <a title=\"Seesmic for iPhone\" href=\"http://seesmic.com/seesmic_mobile/iphone/\">Seesmic for the iPhone</a> just to try it out. \xC2\xA0I don&#8217;t see myself going back anytime soon. \xC2\xA0Even though I miss some of the nicer UI elements of Twitter for iPhone, Seesmic is a nice app that actually allows me to use it to replace 2 apps with it on my front screen.</p>\n\
      <h3>It&#8217;s Twitter, it&#8217;s Facebook, it&#8217;s BOTH</h3>\n\
      <p>The first thing I noticed when I fired up Seesmic for the first time was that it handled <a title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com\">Twitter</a> and Facebook. \xC2\xA0Initial thoughts included &#8220;well if this can do <a title=\"Facebook\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a> too, well I might be able to move Facebook off my front screen too&#8221; and while the Facebook implementation isn&#8217;t 100 percent, it is definitely good enough that I can use it 98% of the time.</p>\n\
      <p>Seesmic for iPhone also handles Twitter searches and lists. \xC2\xA0It has a nice interface that allows for separation of the various lists and networks that doesn&#8217;t come off as cluttered (the way TweetDeck for iPhone did for me). \xC2\xA0With Seesmic, I&#8217;m able to switch between my Twitter timeline, Facebook news feed, and various lists/searches.</p>\n\
      <h3>Navigation</h3>\n\
      <p>One of the cooler things I like about Seesmic is that to navigate between Twitter, Facebook, Ping.FM, and various Twitter lists and searches is that I simply have to swipe left/right depending on where I am in my &#8220;tabs&#8221; (or tiles). \xC2\xA0However this means that the Twitter for iPhone feature that allows you to swipe a tweet is gone (this was one of my favorite features of Twitter for iPhone). \xC2\xA0Even though it means I lose a feature, this one feature makes Seesmic extremely efficient. \xC2\xA0I can jump between accounts and lists with the greatest of ease. \xC2\xA0When I pick up my iPhone to check Twitter, I&#8217;m almost always going to check Facebook too, now I can do it in one app and with just a small swipe of the finger.</p>\n\
      <p>I have to say though that I do find myself missing the Twitter for iPhone tweet swipe shortcut for replying and favoriting tweets. \xC2\xA0On Seesmic this is at least 2 screen presses, and while that might not seem like much, coming from the official Twitter app it just feels clunky. \xC2\xA0However, I understand the reason this can&#8217;t be done in Seesmic and do not overly fault them for it. \xC2\xA0They mad an UI decision and theirs works and is quite efficient, just in a different way and for a different purpose.</p>\n\
      <h3>Overall</h3>\n\
      <p>Overall, I think I&#8217;ll probably keep Seesmic on my front screen for a good while longer than originally anticipated. \xC2\xA0That&#8217;s saying something because I&#8217;ve tried a lot of iPhone Twitter apps and not a single one was able to dethrone Tweetie (as it was known at the time). \xC2\xA0I still thing Twitter for iPhone is a fantastic product and if you&#8217;re looking for a good Twitter app, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find one better. \xC2\xA0I wouldn&#8217;t say that, in the end, Seesmic is better than Twitter for iPhone but it does have certain features for a &#8220;power user&#8221; that can clear some icons off the front screen. \xC2\xA0If you use both Twitter and Facebook with extreme regularity then you need to be taking a hard look at Seesmic for iPhone.</p>\n\

      \t\t<description>With the recent announcement of the new iPhone 4, there's been a lot of talk about how it compares to the latest run of Android devices (HTC EVO, HTC Droid Incredible, and Nexus One).  However anytime someone brings up the Android elephant in the iPhone room, there's talk similar to \"oh well Android is fragmented\" or \"all those apps won't work on your phone\" and other similar phrases.  I want to spend some time today discussing this issue as I see it. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/2010/06/16/android-and-the-fragmentation-fud/\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"meta-nav\"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1551\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" title=\"Android\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/android-robot-logo2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" height=\"264\" />With the recent announcement of the new iPhone 4, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk about how it compares to the latest run of Android devices (HTC EVO, HTC Droid Incredible, and Nexus One). \xC2\xA0However anytime someone brings up the Android elephant in the iPhone room, there&#8217;s talk similar to &#8220;oh well Android is fragmented&#8221; or &#8220;all those apps won&#8217;t work on your phone&#8221; and other similar phrases. \xC2\xA0I want to spend some time today discussing this issue as I see it.</p>\n\
      <h3>Yes it&#8217;s Fragmentation</h3>\n\
      <p>In the strictest definition of the word, the Android world is fragmented. \xC2\xA0You have a lot of devices all running different versions of the Android OS. \xC2\xA0Though Google and the OEMs have worked hard to lower the amount of fragmentation, it&#8217;s still there. \xC2\xA0If you want your app to cover as many devices as possible, you have to (currently) code for Android 1.6. \xC2\xA0With the recent announcement of 2.2, this seems like a poor call. \xC2\xA0Newer versions of Android have new functionality that would be\xC2\xA0beneficial to older phones. \xC2\xA0Specifically the ability to save apps onto the microSD card and keep it out of the onboard memory.</p>\n\
      <p>There is something to be said about the fact that Android is being developed at a fast rate that it&#8217;s hard for manufacturers to keep up. \xC2\xA0Not only is the underlying Android OS being developed at a rapid pace, but each manufacturer has it&#8217;s own variation of the OS. \xC2\xA0HTC has their Sense UI, Motorola has their MotoBLUR technology, and so on. \xC2\xA0Due to this, it takes longer for these manufacturers to release the updated OS versions because they have to put their own touches on the new version before they can push it out. \xC2\xA0In some cases they&#8217;ve decided not to do this.</p>\n\
      <p>The other issue is that a lot of the older Android 1.x devices had limited onboard ROM spaces, which makes updating to the newer OS even more complicated. \xC2\xA0So while this kind of fragmentation exists and it could be viewed as a bad thing, it&#8217;s not always.<span id=\"more-1549\"></span></p>\n\
      <h3>No, it&#8217;s Not Fragmentation</h3>\n\
      <p>Why is it not a bad thing? \xC2\xA0Because it&#8217;s constant improvement of the underlying operating system of the phone. \xC2\xA0Sure you might be on an older device that can&#8217;t update, but that means that they next Android phone you get is going to be better than the one you currently have. \xC2\xA0Before iPhone and Android, such a thing was unheard of. \xC2\xA0Mobile phone makers didn&#8217;t really worry about updating their mobile OS too much, because they didn&#8217;t have too. \xC2\xA0Now with Android, their finding that they need to stay bleeding edge to compete because people are starting to understand the game better.</p>\n\
      <p>Part of the reason for Android&#8217;s fast growth is Google&#8217;s understanding that they had to play catch up a little. \xC2\xA0I&#8217;m not one-sided here, when Android 1.0 came out it paled compared to the recently released iPhone OS 2.0. \xC2\xA0But Google didn&#8217;t rest and quickly pushed out new versions. \xC2\xA0Apple releases their iPhone OS once a year, currently Android is on 2 releases a year. \xC2\xA0They surpasses Apple this year (sorry fanboys, but it&#8217;s true). \xC2\xA0Android has had multitasking from day 1, we have over the air updates, and now over the air syncing. \xC2\xA0Also, the latest Android OS ran circles around both the iPad and the iPhone (with javascript no less, so it wasn&#8217;t even a native app). \xC2\xA0Most of what&#8217;s in iPhone OS 4.0 has been in Android for a while (heck even the multi-tasking is done in a similar manner).</p>\n\
      <p>One important thing to not overlook (again) is that Google is making manufacturers think about things like future software updates, and companies like HTC and Motorola are starting to get hip to the game of continual updates of the operating system. \xC2\xA0They might be slow on the delivery now, but with time we&#8217;ll see more releases and less lag. \xC2\xA0Before Apple and Android, this was unheard of. \xC2\xA0Manufacturers ignored the mobile OS because most people would just buy a new phone. \xC2\xA0Google is making manufacturers think about the mobile OS in the same way that Apple made the carriers think about data. \xC2\xA0After the iPhone data plans became something of a commodity, you got unlimited data at a set price. \xC2\xA0Now equipment makers are going to have think about their devices as something that last longer than that 2 year contract interval. \xC2\xA0Sure the geeks are still going to upgrade regularly, but the average joe isn&#8217;t going to care (they might not care about OS updates, but if their phone tells them there&#8217;s an update to install they&#8217;ll probably install it).</p>\n\
      <p>Google has said that they will eventually slow down the rate of Android releases in fight to\xC2\xA0alleviate\xC2\xA0the fragmentation. \xC2\xA0They understand it&#8217;s an issue, but they also know they need to keep improving their OS in order to hold the lead they now have over Apple.</p>\n\
      <h3>The Current State of Things</h3>\n\
      <p>The image below was posted on the <a title=\"Android Police - Fragmentation Boogeyman\" href=\"http://www.androidpolice.com/2010/06/01/google-update-platform-versions-chart-call-fragmentation-a-bogeyman/\">Android Police</a> website back in January (I tried to find a new infographic but was unable to do so).</p>\n\
      <div id=\"attachment_1550\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 727px\"><a href=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/android_versions_chart.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1550 \" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Android Version Chart\" src=\"http://www.mkoby.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/android_versions_chart-1024x317.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"717\" height=\"222\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Click to Enlarge</p></div>\n\
      <p>As you can see, the fragmentation is slowly\xC2\xA0dissipating. \xC2\xA0Many of the older 1.5 phones don&#8217;t have enough onboard memory to hold the new 2.x versions of Android. \xC2\xA0This is a hardware issue, not a software issue. \xC2\xA0Many of the remaining phones have seem recent announcements about upgrades to 2.x versions. \xC2\xA0By the end of the year, I predict that we&#8217;ll start seeing less phones that are not able to update to newer versions.</p>\n\
      <p>Also, there is an active community of Android developers who are working to get the newer versions of the operating system to be loadable on older phones. \xC2\xA0Of course this isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart and does require some hackery. \xC2\xA0But the ability is there.</p>\n\
      <h3>Things to Consider</h3>\n\
      <p>The issue of fragmentation is a two sided problem. \xC2\xA0It&#8217;s not just Google&#8217;s rapid development of the Android operating system but the manufacturers struggling to keep up. \xC2\xA0Some would argue (rightfully so) that this is where Apple&#8217;s success comes from. \xC2\xA0They couple their hardware and software so tightly together that they can really hone in on the perfection side of things. \xC2\xA0However, this is partially what has caused them to be surpassed by Android in both functionality soon number of available devices.</p>\n\
      <p>I&#8217;m not going to argue that the iPhone is subpar, it&#8217;s not. \xC2\xA0The iPhone is a superb device in a many aspects. \xC2\xA0Android has some nice devices out as well (see the Nexus One or the HTC EVO). \xC2\xA0But Apple isn&#8217;t the only game in the market anymore and Android, regardless of it&#8217;s fragmentation, is proving to be a good competitor. \xC2\xA0And competition is good. \xC2\xA0But I feel that we lose site of the advantages of the rapid development cycle, because there are advantages. \xC2\xA0Apple fanboys would like us to forget those however (and the Google fanboys would like to forget that Apple really does have a tendency to bring its &#8220;A&#8221; game).</p>\n\
      <p>All in all, the competition is a good thing. \xC2\xA0We&#8217;ll be seeing things improve on both ends and I truly believe that Android device makers will shorten the lag between new OS announcements and getting the updates to the phones. \xC2\xA0They&#8217;ll have to if they want to remain competitive.</p>\n\
