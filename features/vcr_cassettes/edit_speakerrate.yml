      4 brings dynamic features to the table, providing developers the ability to
      address certain scenarios that can''t be easily implemented in a statically
      typed language. That doesn''t mean C# is now a dynamic language, or that you
      should make everything dynamic; it means that we have a few additions to our
      toolbox that come in really handy when trying to nail some special cases that
      come our way. In this session we will take a look at how the dynamic features
