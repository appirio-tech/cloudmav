      heard from many sources that my productivity would increase if I used Vim as
      my text editor. I attempted to scale the steep learning cliff (not so much a
      curve...). One week I decided that I would learn by forcing myself to use vim
      all week. Since that week I''ve embraced my inner vim. In this talk I will go
      over the resources I used to learn vim and the basic cool operations that I
      love with vim. Topics will include basic text operations, vimrc, creating color
      schemes, and using vim plugins. If you ever wanted to give vim a shot but didn''t

      that everybody can understand and start thinking about patterns in a more natural
